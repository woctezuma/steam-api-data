As such, it also contains verbal descriptions of crimes which some may find disturbing or anxiety-provoking.\r\n\r\nVirtual reality (VR) is an immersive experience that can be intense. Certain risks may include, but are not limited to, injury resulting from malfunction of the equipment, motion sickness, nausea, dizziness, seizures, disorientation, loss of balance, tripping, falling, and post-traumatic stress disorder responses. VR is a new technology and there may be additional unknown and nonobvious risk associated with VR technology. Participation is at your own risk."
