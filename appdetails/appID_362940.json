  "detailed_description": "<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">About</h2>Courier of the Crypts is a 2D puzzle-action adventure game where you have to survive as a courier on his first errand to the guardian of the crypts. Your main tool to achieve your mission is a magic torch which you use to illuminate your path, defend from evil spirits and solve puzzles.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">PLEASE NOTE:</h2>This is not an RPG, this is not Roguelike, this is not a game with procedurally generated maps - this is a Storyline adventure game which includes puzzles, action and exploration. All the maps are carefully crafted to produce the most enjoyable experience for a player.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">The Magic Torch</h2>The main aspect of the game is your magic torch. The environment will react to its flames in different ways so it will be common for you to toggle the flame on and off throughout the game. Some enemies will leave you alone while others will try to extinguish the torch. It's up to you to learn all about them and use that knowledge to your advantage. You can lure some enemies into traps or sneak past them. Will you let Dark Moths drink your light or attack you? There are also riddles in the dark that only the magic flame reveals. Enemies and puzzles should not be your main worry though. You must keep your torch filled with magic flame all the time otherwise dark spirits will come to get you. Use your torch flame wisely and look after the flame.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Features</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Ambiental and carefully hand-crafted maps full of puzzles and secrets. <br></li><li>Magic torch - light your path, scare off the enemies, solve puzzles.... <br></li><li>Deadly traps and rich treasures <br></li><li>Simple yet appealing story with a twist. <br></li><li>Beautiful pixelated graphics. <br></li><li>Music and visuals for perfect ominous ambient. <br></li><li>Crypt map with secret maps to unlock (similar to Super Mario World world map) <br></li><li>Meet the spirits and buy some upgrades. <br></li><li>Perfection system. <br></li><li>Challenging achievements. <br></li><li>Full controller support.</li></ul>",
