Then oh boy is Bot Land the game for you!<br><br>In Bot Land, all of your bots follow <strong>scripts</strong> (so you can snap your controller in half for all we care). You'll tell your bots how to perform actions <i>ahead of time</i>, that way they don't need a lousy human to control them mid-battle. This allows your bots to fight even while you're offline; they'll protect your CPU against other players' attacks.<br><br>Now, let's be honest... you're a great gamer\u2014that's why you're reading this description\u2014but even <i>you</i> might still lose a match or two. That's where replays come in handy. Maybe your opponent cloaked, bypassed your bots, and destroyed your CPU while your own bots were busy calculating prime numbers with a billion digits. You can use that information to improve for next time.<br><br>Then, after improving your defense, you can attack other players' CPUs in the same way. Maybe you've got a killer strategy involving <strong>LANDMINES</strong> or <strong>TELEPORTATION</strong> or <strong>OTHER BOLDED WORDS</strong>, the likes of which no one has ever <i>seen</i> before. You finally find the perfect chump on which to unleash this onslaught. They've got measly bots with <strong>artillery</strong> and <strong>shields</strong>, so you teleport behind them, misquote a meme, and punch them in their shiny metal backs. You're the top dog-bot now.<br><br>And when you win...? Oh, don't even get us started. You'll earn <strong>Botcoin</strong>, which, through a myriad of steps, roughly translates to <strong>fame and fortune</strong> in real life (the steps are really just a sense of satisfaction and a profound feeling of &quot;the courage was within me the entire time!&quot;; Botcoin isn't a cryptocurrency). You'll buy new items, make new strategies, teach a wasp bot how to love, ponder whether we're all just living in a simulation, and then look up how to remove wasp-bot stingers from your arm.
