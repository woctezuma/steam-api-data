This adventure designed for 4th level characters stands on its own as a lush atmospheric journey into the dangers and mysteries of the wild, but it is especially suited for characters in a Kingbreaker Adventure Path campaign as they explore the unforgiving lands of a savage frontier and find them not uninhabited. As their kingdom expands, can your heroes manage to forge peace with the xenophobic clans and cold-hearted fey of the lonely hills and the frightening fury of nature itself that threaten to rise up and devour barbarian village and new-founded kingdom alike?</i><br><br>Written by Jason Nelson, with art by Frank Hessefort and maps by ENnie-award-winning cartographer Todd Gamble, this epic adventure features 3 new/variant creatures and a variety of harrowing challenges of mind, heart, and strength. Cold Mountain continues Legendary Games' tradition of bringing you outstanding content by the best authors in the business, combined with amazing art and production values and innovative layout design, including an appendix of player-friendly text-free map handouts. We hope you enjoy using our products as much as we enjoy making them, and that you'll keep coming back again and again to Make Your Game Legendary!<br><br><strong>Requires:</strong> An active subscription or a one time purchase of a Fantasy Grounds Full or Ultimate license and the included Pathfinder ruleset (3.5E Compatible).",
