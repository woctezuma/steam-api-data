Your method of movement will be predetermined by the application, this will put you into one of three teams. Team A, uses trackpad/analouge stick movement to explore the world.

The team with the most stars wins! The results of the competition may be used in academic research to analyse how each team handled the situation and assess pros and cons of each method. You can re-play the experiment as much as you like, however, your contribution will only be considered for the original team you were allocated.
