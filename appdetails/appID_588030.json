  "detailed_description": "Derail Valley is a train simulation made for VR. Pick assignments, drive trains and build your career in a vast railway network.

Don't worry though, the view from the cliff will be astonishing.<br><br>While still early in development by a three-people team, Derail Valley brings many advancements to both VR and train simulation games:<br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Unmatched immersion level</h2><br>Push levers and press buttons with your own hands.
