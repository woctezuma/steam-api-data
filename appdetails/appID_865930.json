  "reviews": "\u201cSome creators out there took the tools to heart, crafting complete mini-RPGs with a story, dialogue, secrets, boss battles, and a princess to save. These are the creators who will make Block Quest Maker worth playing, and developer Wonderland Kazakiri did an outstanding job of giving them everything they need to make some memorable, chibi-size adventures.\u201d<br>7.5 \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.destructoid.com/review-block-quest-maker-538431.phtml\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\"  >Destructoid</a><br><br>\u201cWhile we all wait for the inevitable porting of Super Mario Maker to Switch, BlockQuest Maker provides a perfectly serviceable alternative for anyone eager to create and share their own devious levels with friends and strangers alike.\u201d<br>8 \u2013 <a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=https://www.gamegrin.com/reviews/bqm-blockquest-maker-review/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >GameGrin</a><br><br>\u201cFor people who love designing video game levels but don\u2019t have or desire coding knowledge, BQM -BlockQuest Maker- is something you need in your life. BQM takes gameplay mechanics from old Legend of Zelda games \u2013 bombs, arrows, fire rods, keys, pushing blocks, etc.\u2014and gives you the tools to make your own levels out of these elements. The result is a simple yet robust game maker that allows you to make countless thrilling challenges. And it very well might be the closest we get to receiving a \u201cLegend of Zelda Maker\u201d on the Switch.\u201d<br>8.5 \u2013 <a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=https://www.nintendoenthusiast.com/2019/01/08/bqm-blockquest-maker-review/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >Nintendo Enthusiast</a><br>",
