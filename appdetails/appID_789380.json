It can be a small database of games, a downloadable art show, a simulation, a moving painting, an album, an existential crisis, a talisman, a play, a meditation, a spell, a forest, a distopian nightmare, a joke. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe amount of interaction and exploration is not a ton. If you explore and play through everything it would take maybe an hour or so at most. <br />\r\n-There are small games and walking sims to play on machines in abandoned buildings.<br />\r\n-You can chat with other players in the multiplayer mode and see if they are human or machine<br />\r\n-There is a band and a small secret lair<br />\r\n-There is no beginning or end<br />\r\n-There is no winning or losing<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAnd there is an infinite, dramatic cycle of accumulation and destruction: <br />\r\n<br />\r\nHit the number 3 key. You can choose the perspective of 3 NPC actors or a stage overview. They are acting out an absurdist play. They are the sole survivors of a human apocalypse. They are trying to procreate to start civilization over again but they\u2019re having a hard time. They are sending emails to nowhere, gossiping, meditating, taking naps, cleaning up. They\u2019re collecting artifacts around the stage and building a machine. When the machine is done it generates an AI and then blows up. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nTo see what the NPCs do you can leave the simulation on at a party, in a room while you are doing other things, etc. It could run for many hours and you will see, read and hear different things. <br />\r\nIf you have a few computers you can link them up and see different perspectives at once. With multiple channels of the atmospheric sounds it becomes a sort of instrument or generative album as well. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nBefore you download, I encourage you to download the 100+ page manual which I am giving away for free. Click the \u201cView the manual\u201d on the right hand side of this page and download it. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nMusic by:<br />\r\nGlamour Lakes - glamourlakes.bandcamp.com<br />\r\nX-Coast - soundcloud.com/x-coast<br />\r\nRipCD - ripcd.bandcamp.com<br />\r\n<br />\r\n******************<br />\r\n-This is not for everyone.
