However, as he progresses through the camp, our contestant soon realizes exactly how the Regime and the show operate.

To reach freedom and family, you must lead the protagonist through each of the Arenas while under the ever-watchful mechanical eye of the Regime. The variety of hazardous, dilapidated environments hold an array of obstacles for you to manage\u2014leg-shattering drops (scared of heights?), flaming barrels of garbage (extra-smelly, extra-flamey), inconveniently-placed spike pits (of course), hanging steel beams (so much rust)\u2014but none of this is to speak of the fates of those you meet along the way.<br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/874040/extras/Preview_4.png?t=1553542065\" ><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>FEATURES</strong></h2><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Cinematic platformer: Run, jump, crash, and climb your way through each Arena as the narrative unfolds around you.
