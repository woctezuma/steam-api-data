Even in modern times, beliefs and superstitions about the paranormal continue to persist. Fears and anxieties about hexes, haints, and hags are simply part of life, even for many who by their religious faith and adherence to scientific thought should condemn such beliefs. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nBugs 'N Boo Hags places you in this strange world. You are Jack McCleary, the longtime &quot;witchdoctor sheriff&quot; of Beaufort County who uses white magic to reverse the effects of dark spells and hexes. As Sheriff McCleary, you must defend the homes of your citizens from invasion by that most dreaded of evil spirits, the Boo Hag, who has the power to drain a sleeping person's life-force to the point of paralysis\u2014or even death. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nConventional weapons don't work\u2014instead, your arsenal consists of mojo bags, corn brooms, salt shakers, and &quot;haint blue&quot; paint. The Boo Hag knows you're coming, however, and she has recruited an army of frightful creatures to stand in your way. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nWill you be able to save the people of Beaufort County, or will the Boo Hag ride them to death? It's time to grab your paintbrush and find out! <br />\r\n<br />\r\nBugs 'N Boo Hags is a 2D single-screen arcade style platformer with tower defense elements, an 80s pixel-art look, and original chiptune music. Both the graphics and gameplay are inspired by the history, culture, and folklore of the South Carolina lowcountry region, particularly in and around the historic seaside city of Beaufort and the surrounding Sea Islands. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nDesigned to appeal to both core gamers as well as those who are nostalgic for an authentic retro arcade experience, Bugs 'N Boo Hags is being developed for Windows PCs with a release planned for late summer 2019.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAs the local people say, \u201cDon't let de hag ride ya!\u201d",
