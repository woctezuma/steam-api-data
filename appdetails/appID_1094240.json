  "detailed_description": "<i>Esper - Make You Live Again</i> is a kinetic novel in which Ryo Masaki tells his story whereas he was only a young student in an Esper academy. <br><br>The Espers are humans with special abilities. They can, when a person is suffering, share the pain and see the past and the memories of that person. Using their powers and their understanding of the problem, the Espers can help the person, and give them the will to live again. <br><br>Ryo tells what happened when he passed his exam to become a certified Esper and how these events impacted his life and the life of many others to the point that they changed him forever.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">The demo version</h2>The demo includes about the first 30 minutes of the story as well as all the other features of the game (options, gallery, jukebox, bonus, replay, load/save, etc), though they are limited by what can be unlocked in the demo version.
