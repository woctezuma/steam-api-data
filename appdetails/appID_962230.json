Here\u2019s a closer look at what you can do with Quicken WillMaker Plus:<br />\r\nYour Will<br />\r\nThe heart of every estate plan is a will, also known as a last will and testament. This legal document puts you in control of who inherits your property and who would take care of your children if it were ever necessary. Without a will, state law determines these issues. Your will also allows you to name an executor (sometimes called a \u201cpersonal representative\u201d) to carry out our wishes. And you can appoint a trusted person to manage property left to young people.

For example, bills must be paid, bank deposits must be made and someone must handle insurance and benefits paperwork. In most cases, a durable power of attorney for finances is the best way to take care of tasks like these.<br />\r\nYour Final Arrangements<br />\r\nPlan a funeral or other ceremony and ease the burden on your loved ones. Describe your preferences for burial, cremation, memorials, obituaries and more.<br />\r\nDocuments for Your Executor<br />\r\nMake sure your executor has needed forms and instructions to do the job: checklists, letters, notices and claim forms.<br />\r\nInformation for Caregivers and Survivors<br />\r\nOrganize your information so that your survivors don't have to.
