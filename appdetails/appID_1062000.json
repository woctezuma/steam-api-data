Build farms and grow crops for food. Place heaters to prevent hypothermia. Construct med bays and assign doctors to treat wounds, cure diseases, and replace limbs.  <br></li><li><strong>Express Yourself</strong> - Customize your station with 18 unique wall types, 12 different floors, and over 50 distinct objects. Paint objects with 8 different color choices. Place cheerful paintings to remind the colonists how friendly and relatable you are, and motivational posters to let them know how much you value their productivity. Design fancy kitchens, luxurious bedrooms, and industrial docking bays.<br></li><li><strong>Power, Water, and Atmosphere</strong> - Provide power by connecting machines with wires. Prepare against blackouts by creating separate or redundant grids for your vital machines. Use pipes and water recyclers to convert dirty farm water into clean, drinkable water. Establish separate atmospheres with the help of vents and air ducts.</li></ul><br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1062000/extras/Description_Header_Colonists.gif?t=1560187155\" ><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>Grow Humans</strong> - Colonists are grown in bio-tanks and assigned a consciousness from Earth. Create stations full of clones. Regrow your favorite colonists. Upload a mind into the wrong body, and observe the effects of sleeve sickness--for science.<br></li><li><strong>Jobs</strong> - Assign roles like farmer, doctor, miner, and security guard. Watch as your rookie chef acquires experience and becomes a seasoned pro, unlocking tastier and more exotic recipes.<br></li><li><strong>Unique Colonists</strong> - With randomized hair color and style, eye color, and skin color, there are over 8000 visual variations of colonist. These variations go beyond aesthetics, too. Some colonists prefer studying in their room, while others like to drink and socialize in the bar. Every game is different--your station and colonists will be unique to you.  <br></li><li><strong>Memories and Rumors</strong> - Colonists remember the good (and bad) things that happen to them. These memories are shared, during conversation, and spread throughout the station like wildfire. Leave no witnesses.<br></li><li><strong>Personal Relationships</strong> - Colonists get extra sad when something bad happens to a friend, but they love to watch an enemy suffer. If you jettison a popular colonist you might have a mutiny on your hands.</li></ul><br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1062000/extras/Description_Header_Starmap.gif?t=1560187155\" ><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>Procedural World</strong> - The solar system is dynamically generated each playthrough with planets, moons, asteroids, stations, and other factions.

No one knows what motivates a crazy colonist; they're simultaneously responsible for the greatest technological innovations and messiest homicidal rampages. This is why doors have locks. It's also why you can depressurize a single room--a great way to enforce bed time.<br></li><li><strong>Mutiny</strong> - Unhappy colonists will stop working.
