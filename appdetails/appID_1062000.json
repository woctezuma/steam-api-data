Build farms and grow crops for food. Place heaters to prevent hypothermia. Construct med bays and assign doctors to treat wounds, cure diseases, and replace limbs.  <br></li><li><strong>Express Yourself</strong> - Customize your station with 18 unique wall types, 12 different floors, and over 50 distinct objects.

Place cheerful paintings to remind the colonists how friendly and relatable you are, and motivational posters to let them know how much you value their productivity.

No one knows what motivates a crazy colonist; they're simultaneously responsible for the greatest technological innovations and messiest homicidal rampages. This is why doors have locks.
