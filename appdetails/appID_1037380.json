All that he loved was ripped away from him in a matter of moments and his torment lead to his inevitable turn in character. He mourned and vowed that he would bend the laws of the world to his will to obtain what was once lost. With pain weighing upon his heart, he devised a plan to create a being powerful enough to grant him his wish; to gain what was taken from him years ago.<br>He gathered warriors on the volcanic island one by one and told everyone to fight each other to grow stronger and learn from one another. He has specifically chosen these warriors for their knowledge and powers to accomplish his goals. In the end the Great Architect man promised gold and whatever they desire to the one who wins.<br>Slimes are creepy minion like things that are the henchmen of the Great Architect man created using dark magic to cause order on the island and making it so that it is impossible to escape the island or not fight one another. One wrong move, and one may be tortured into submission by them.<br>Visit our website to learn more about the game story.",
