  "detailed_description": "Fly the Italian Macchi 202, the best Italian fighter plane that saw action at the Eastern front of WWII!<br><br>The Macchi combines rather moderate size of German Messerschmitts with the robustness of a Focke-Wulf. It has a tough framework with all-metal construction throughout the airframe and two-spar wings, the only exception being the rudder. A unique feature of the Macchi is its peculiar wing design which is is asymmetrical. The left wing is 20 cm longer than the right one to counteract torque produced by the engine. The wings don\u2019t have leading edge slats and the landing gear is generally similar to the FW-190 which is quite wide and serviceable. There\u2019s a trim stabilizer for the elevators, but no trim tabs on any other flight surface.<br><br>The overall approach to the framework design is a bit surprising: on the one hand the aircraft is aerodynamically clean and well designed; on the other hand both of its radiator cowlings look ill-placed causing much drag. <br><br>The engine is an export version of the DB601A that was also used in earlier Bf-109 models. But unlike the Bf-109s in our game, this one doesn\u2019t have a good automated constant-speed propeller mechanism. The Macchi\u2019s propeller only has two basic positions: 2200 and 2400 rpm. All other modes are up to the pilot to set up and maintain by controlling the prop pitch manually. Water and oil radiator controls are manual as well.
