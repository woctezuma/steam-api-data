  "detailed_description": "<h1>Welcome, Detectives</h1><p>Hey detectives, we hope you like this game and enjoy the unique non-linear audio-driven gameplay experience.<br><br>We strove to create a different narrative-driven gameplay experience, which makes Unheard a very 'maverick' work for the players and us either. Since a 'different' has an underlying meaning of &quot;indefinite&quot;, this project means a whole new challenge for us to fuse splendid storytelling and puzzle solving together. We are definitely appreciated all your understanding and we believe that Unheard has the potential and capacity to flourish a new way to experience stories of other genres more than mystery in the near future in your supporting.<br><br>There are five chapters with full Chinese and English voices in the first version, and meanwhile we are planning to make a free DLC in a couple of months to update.<br><br><strong>Please feel free to comment and get in touch with us!</strong> We would like to check and read every feedbacks from time to time. With your voices, we could make Unheard even better! <br><br>Last of all, we wish Unheard would make you feel like...it's really worth the wait.

Use the voices you hear to return to crime scenes, tracking down each individual involved and solving the cases. But where do the voices come from? Can you trust what you hear?

Every clue, every move, and every motive will be presented in the form of audio. Rather than controlling any one character, you only need listen to their conversations, following along as the story evolves. Use the information you hear to match names to voices and determine how everything (and everyone) is related.
