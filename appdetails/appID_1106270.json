You might think it\u2019s going to be a retro pixel art thing at first but then you see the animations, you see how every single one is packed with more frames than an entire NES cartridge&quot;</i><br> - <strong>Rock Paper Shotgun</strong><br><br><i>&quot;All that family personality (...) shines through in large part due to the artwork and animations&quot;.</i><br> - <strong>Destructoid</strong><br><br><i>&quot;I\u2019ve never seen a family in a game so large and colorful as the Bergsons. Each character is instantly identifiable despite the cluttered, riotous art style, and each is distinct from the others in animation and playstyle&quot;.</i><br> - <strong>Medium</strong></p><br><h1>About the Game</h1><strong><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">NOTE: </h2></strong><br>This is a demo version for Children of Morta.

With the Corruption spreading through the land, guardians of the Mountain Morta have to stand up against the ancient evil.
