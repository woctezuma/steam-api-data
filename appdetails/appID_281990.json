  "reviews": "\u201cCalling Stellaris Europa Universalis in space is probably reductive, but it was the first thing I did in this review not because they are almost exactly alike, but because, when I put away my empires and get on with my day, the stories that have played out in these digital worlds embed themselves in my brain, and I so desperately want to tell people about them. Both games tickle the part of my brain that wants every battle to have some greater context, every move I make to be part of a larger narrative. Stellaris manages to do this without history to lean on, though, and does so with aplomb.\u201d<br>9/10 \u2013 <a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://www.pcgamesn.com/stellaris-review\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >PCGamesN</a></a><br><br>\u201cStellaris is easy to comprehend and exciting to execute, which is a perfect combination for a genre notoriously difficult to break into.\u201d<br>9/10 \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.destructoid.com/review-stellaris-358688.phtml\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\"  >Destructoid</a></a><br><br>\u201cRight now, Stellaris is a very good space-based strategy game, but a few months down the road, it could evolve into a fantastic one\u201d<br>8.2/10 \u2013 <a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://www.hookedgamers.com/pc/stellaris/review/article-1659.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >Hooked Gamers</a></a><br>",
