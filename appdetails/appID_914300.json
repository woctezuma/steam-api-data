It is similar to Corpse Party, Some people may find the story and narrative to be religiously offensive. Depictions of drug use occur throughout, violence is a common fixture of the narrative. The game delves into into as terrorism and war. People are depicted as harming themselves, people have their eyes gouged out, and die in a large variety of ways, over and over again. Support characters are killed off in rapid succession. The game is vulgar. Not recommended for children."
