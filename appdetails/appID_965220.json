The time has come for the foul Skaven to pay the butcher\u2019s bill for their plague-spreading acts, and pay they will \u2013 with their very lives! Tehenauin marshals his fellow Red-Crested Skinks: there will be a sacrifice. A vast, crimson sacrifice.

His aptitude for science and invention is unrivalled, but as well as being the greatest Skaven Warlock Engineer of all time, Ikit Claw has also developed an awesome command of the Winds of Magic. His exceptional scientific knowledge and magical powers have made him indispensable to the Council of Thirteen. <br><br>In his quest for destruction, Ikit seeks to realise his grandest design \u2013 the mighty Doomsphere \u2013 and he will stop at nothing to unleash it upon the world\u2026<br><br>Clan Skryre brings several unique faction features and mechanics to Total War: WARHAMMER II:<br><br><strong>Clan Skryre Forbidden Workshop</strong><br><br>With access to the infamous Forbidden Workshop, Clan Skryre players can spend resources to upgrade various units such as Doomwheels, Doom-flayers and Weapons Teams with powerful new stat-boosts and attributes.

They are crafted in the Forbidden Workshop, and can be stockpiled for use, though only one Doomrocket from the stockpile may be launched per battle.

As he led a migration out of the defiled city of Chaqua where the disease began, he prophesised the coming of the Serpent-God and rallied the surviving population of Lizardmen to join his counterattack. As Sotek\u2019s cult grew, so too did the Prophet\u2019s following, and for many years Tehenhauin led his apostles to many victories, slaughtering countless captives as sacrificial offerings in the hope that their spilt blood would bring forth the Serpent-God himself.<br><br>The Cult of Sotek faction brings two new campaign mechanics to Total War: WARHAMMER II:<br><br><strong>Prophecy of Sotek</strong><br>Tehenauin believes that with sufficient sacrifices, the serpent-god may yet return, bringing salvation to the Lizardmen and the extermination of the Skaven.
