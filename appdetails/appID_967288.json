In all, over 250 locomotives (classified as the \u00d6BB 1042) would be built over 14 years, making them an important part of day-to-day mixed-traffic operations.<br><br>Fast forward to the 1990s, and the oldest of the \u00d6BB 1042s (the 1042.0s) were due to be replaced. Orders for the next generation were placed, meanwhile, the fate of the younger 1042.5s was discussed. It was decided that the newer series, if suitably converted, would be perfect for \u201cWendezug\u201d (shuttle train) duties.<br><br>The rebuilt locomotives were reclassified as the \u00d6BB 1142, and they immediately got to work on shuttle passenger duties across the Austrian network.<br><br>In recent years, some locomotives have been retired, or been sold to other operators in Europe, however \u00d6BB still retain a fleet of 45 for their own use. All told, for a design pushing through its mid-50s, the \u00d6BB 1142 represents an outstanding feat of engineering, and thanks to Skyhook Games, it has arrived for Train Simulator in fully fledged Pro Range fashion!<br><br> <h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Included Scenarios</h2><br>The \u00d6BB 1142 includes a trio of engaging scenarios for the Semmeringbahn route.<br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>[1142] A wintry ride<br></li><li>[1142] Freight Train Gloggnitz - M\u00fcrzzuschlag<br></li><li>[1142] Regional train on Semmering</li></ul><br><strong>Please Note: <a href=\"https://store.steampowered.com/app/325990\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\"  >Semmeringbahn - M\u00fcrzzuschlag to Gloggnitz Route Add-On</a> is required, as a separate purchase, in order to play the scenarios featured in this add-on.</strong><br><br>More scenarios are available on the Steam Workshop online and in-game.
