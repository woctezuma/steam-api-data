  "reviews": "\u201cThrough the years, I've used different audio editing programs, and for me, Wave Pad has been the best for me. It's easy to learn, easy to use, and it does exactly what I need to record new songs, as well as stories (in WAVE and sometimes in MP3 formats) for my radio program. Moreover, recently, when I had a nightmare computer problem and had to re-install WP a few times, the company understood my plight, and I did not lose the right to use the software.\u201d<br>5.0 \u2013 <a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R23DTVOL3ZMUCH/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&amp;ASIN=B00YQ064EQ\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >Amazon</a></a><br><br>\u201cHad song edited within 10 minutes after loading program.\u201d<br>5.0 \u2013 <a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1JPP1BBR6YN0B/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&amp;ASIN=B0031QGPTA\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >Amazon</a></a><br>",
