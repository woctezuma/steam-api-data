  "detailed_description": "<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Overview</h2>Can you imagine having other people live inside your head? <br>The protagonist of this story, Dorothy Watson, is a 14-years-old girl who just started middle school. From the outside she looks like a normal teenager but she has scars and pains that most children don\u2019t have. Dorothy experienced trauma as a child and developed dissociative identity disorder, commonly known as multiple personality disorder, which split her into several personalities.<br><br>Alice, who\u2019s as innocent as a child but sees things that others cannot.<br>Gretel, whose blinding rage makes her wary of everyone.<br>Cindy, always positive and outgoing, who doesn\u2019t really like Dorothy for being an introvert.<br><br>If you don\u2019t help her, Dorothy might not be able to adjust to her new life.<br>Fortunately there\u2019s still hope. You have the power to talk to the different personalities including Dorothy, when Dorothy is asleep. In her Dream Space, you can become the counsellor for Dorothy and the other kids. Use your power to integrate the split personalities into Dorothy.<br>But do be careful! The personalities are very sensitive to your questions and answers. One wrong answer can drive the wedge between you and them, tearing the kids apart beyond repair. Dorothy\u2019s life is in your hands and your choices will have direct impact on her.<br>Remember only you can save Dorothy!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">How to play</h2>You will become a counsellor and talk to 4 personalities once per week in Dorothy\u2019s dream.
