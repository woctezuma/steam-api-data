Using your keen military eye, you will direct an entire army\u2019s movements and attacks. As you begin conquering territory after territory, you must think like a commander and balance available resources and supplies throughout your army. The design of each military camp affects production levels, which should exceed the needs of your soldiers. Without housing, food, medical care, and more, your troops won\u2019t survive on the battlefield.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Building</h2>Each territory is controlled from a Castrum (military camp) that is occupied by soldiers. In order to keep the army feed and healthy, different buildings such as barracks, watch towers, and medical tents will have to be constructed. Balancing resources and preparing enough defenses can make the difference between victory and defeat when an attack comes.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Combat</h2>Varying unit combinations require strategic forethought and accurate predictions of enemy attacks. Each unit gains an advantage against specific units and has weaknesses against others. This means unit combinations play a critical role in the outcome of battles. This rock-paper-scissors style of balance creates strategic depth in the game.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Strategy</h2>The world map is used to plan attacks, and decide which territories need reinforcement. While holding more territory generates increased income and resources, it leaves you open to attacks. Striking the right balance between expansion and defense is an important skill in a war of conquest.",
