  "detailed_description": "Zero Gravity is a beautiful first-person/third-person puzzle-platformer simulation game where you will undergo four types of gamemodes. In Zero Gravity, you must really use your mind and patience in order to be able to progress through the game.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Puzzle Gamemode</h2>In the Puzzle gamemode, you will have to solve puzzling challenges that will require you to really use your mind and patience. You will have a suit that allows you to invert gravity so that you are able to walk on the ceiling and also have a jetpack boost that is useful for situations where you need to get up to somewhere.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">EVA Gamemode</h2>In the EVA gamemode, you will be in full zero gravity environments where you will be required to solve space missions like repairing a satellite or rescue a ship that is falling back in to Earth. You will have the abilities to use your suit thrusters to navigate around, however, you will have limited fuel which means you must use your fuel wisely.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Docking Gamemode</h2>The Docking gamemode is classed as a hardcore simulator which follows like-real science based from NASA. In this gamemode, you will fly spaceships and attempt to dock with stations or other spaceships. This will require a lot of patience as the missions can take up to a long period depending on how familiar you are with the controls and science based in space.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Platformer Gamemode</h2>The Platformer gamemode is a fun-casual mode where you will be placed in a zero gravity environment, but the player will have gravity. This means that some of the platforms you jump on in the levels may sink and some may even be explosive and cause you and the environment to go unstable. You will have a suit that is equipped with a zero gravity feature that has limited use and a jetpack that has rechargeable capabilities installed.",
