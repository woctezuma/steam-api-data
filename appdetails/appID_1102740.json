  "detailed_description": "Going Up? is the first of it's kind, Indie tower-climber RPG. Head up a floor to fight, or go back down to regroup and item up. The choice is yours, but you must decide wisely. One item could mean riches gained, while another will only lead to death!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nGodfreyluck Game's debut: Going Up?, contains all the traditional elements of an RPG with a new twist. The intricate item typing system forces a player to choose their items carefully, giving this game a bit of a puzzler twist. We've also included upgrades for armor and skills, as well as a store. Please note that this game is still in Very Early Access. It is playable, but not much more than a demo at this time. We are working as fast as we can to get more content out ASAP! Every copy sold will help us get there quicker, so thanks for the support!",
