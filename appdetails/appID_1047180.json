Electronic warfare, large-scale building destruction, environmental mechanics, new enemy units and more make the urban sprawl a whole new battlefield.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Urban Warfare </h2>Street brawls introduce new tactical gameplay challenges as \u2018Mech combat moves from wide-open natural landscapes to vast urban sprawls. Every building in the new urban biome is fully destructible, so you\u2019re never more than a few salvos away from a new line of sight, or the defensive cover of high-rise rubble. Destroyed coolant exchanger buildings, and broken electrical transformers that disrupt targeting will drastically change the battle as you go.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Electronic Warfare </h2>The return of these lost technologies will forever change the 31st century battlefield. \u2018Mechs equipped with Electronic Countermeasures (ECM) and nearby friendly units are obscured from enemy targeting systems and immune to indirect fire. Meanwhile, \u2018Mechs equipped with Active Probe can reveal, locate, and target enemy units that would otherwise be hidden.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Two New BattleMechs</h2>The experimental Raven 1X sports an advanced electronic warfare package that combines ECM and Active Probe systems into a lightweight component. The Javelin is a compromise between speed and firepower, with close-range knockout power.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">New Flashpoints</h2>A wide variety of new branching short stories that link together mercenary missions, crew conversations, special events, critical choices, and rare bonus rewards.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Three New Enemy Vehicles</h2>The Gallant Urban Assault Tank sports a variety of weapons to fight at all ranges with speed and agility, the Packrat is a battlefield support vehicle equipped with a prototype version of ECM, and the Rotunda is a reconnaissance vehicle equipped with a prototype version of Active Probe.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">New Encounter</h2>Attack and Defend is a challenging new mission type where your mercenaries must destroy an enemy\u2019s base to stop a steady stream of attackers before they can overcome your forces and knock out your employer\u2019s base.<br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1047180/extras/BTUW_LandscapeGIF_Night.gif?t=1559670190\" >",
