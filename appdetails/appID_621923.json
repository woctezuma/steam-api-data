An evolutionary refinement of EMD\u2019s \u201c40 Line\u201d of diesels, the Dash 2 locomotives featured improved traction motors and alternators, strengthened components in the EMD 645-power plant, and solid-state modular components in the electrical and control systems. Among the \u201cDash 2\u201d line was a standard SD45-2, but giant Southern Pacific issued a special request to EMD to better equip its locomotives to operate efficiently in the harsh and hot conditions found within SP\u2019s long tunnels and snow sheds. Accordingly, the 3,600-horsepower, six-axle SD45T-2 (the \u201cT\u201d standing for \u201cTunnel\u201d) was designed with rear air intakes located right above the frame to access cleaner air in tunnels and snow sheds and radiators placed at the top of the boxy rear of the locomotive.

Along with these liveries, the SP SD45T-2 is also provided with standard and \u201cL\u201d style windshield designs, and with winter snow covering.<br><br>And that\u2019s not all. The pack features a remarkable selection of freight equipment, including a Gunderson articulated 5-table Twin-Stack car (in empty, single-stack, and double-stack configurations); a 50-foot \u201cHydra-Cushion\u201d livery SP boxcar; Pacific Fruit Express R-70-12 mechanical refrigerator car; and a SP C40-7 steel bay-window caboose.
