A restart of the video and selecting quality level 3 will fix this, however, selecting quality level 4 is still likely to not work. We have observed best results if we let the Steam 360 Video player automatically adjust the quality level, which you can do by pressing the 'a' key on your keyboard when the Steam 360 Video player is active.
