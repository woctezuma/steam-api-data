Explore the slums of the poorer districts and wind your way through sketchy alleyways lurking with hidden dangers. Tread the paved stones of the upper echelon and visit the High Streets and their trade markets amid swirling tendrils of smoke. Lose yourself in the meandering clusters of buildings, on the street, by rooftop or even delve below ground into the ominous sewers.
