Buildings are destroyed and constructed. And they have a direct impact on what can be bought in the market. Tired from the world that you played but want the same party? Go on, generate a brand new world to explore with your favorite band of misfits. Day night cicle included. And it changes with the seasons too! And a weather system with clouds and fog.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Characters</h2>You can create a party that is composed by different characters. Everything is permited. Want a warrior that plow through enemies with powerful attacks? Check. Want a more cunning and evasive one? You got it. Mages that can harness a destructive power? Or maybe a more defensive and healing oriented one? Maybe a support druid kind? You got it covered! Even a mix between all of this is possible (and can even be VERY powerful). There are still five races to pick. Oh, and appearence is customizeable for each character too!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">The Rules</h2>The rules are simple and are based on:<br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Small numbers (3 Attributes ranging from 0 to 5, Health 10 to 20 and so on)<br></li><li>Rock-Paper-Scissors mind set (a tool, skill and strategy for each case)<br></li><li>Less is more mentality (texts and descriptions are reduced to be in a line or less)</li></ul><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Animated Combat</h2><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1090930/extras/Holy.gif?t=1560514399\" >",
