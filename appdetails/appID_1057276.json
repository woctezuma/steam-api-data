Boasting high energy restoration speeds, it has short emergency charge times, as well. <br />\r\nThe plasma core is a flight unit's heart. Its abilities will change depending on the core equipped. As such, a high quality core can provide the high amount of power needed for flight. Furthermore, since highly destructive weapons need an immense amount of power, they require a powerful core for maximum effectiveness. With all of that in mind, it's no exaggeration to say that a Wing Diver's battle performance depends on their core.&quot;",
