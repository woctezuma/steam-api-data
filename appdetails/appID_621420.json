To avoid distractions, mastiff leader Khampa (J.K. Simmons) forbids all music from the mountain, but when Khampa's son Bodi (Luke Wilson) discovers a radio dropped from a passing airplane, it takes just a few guitar licks for his fate to be sealed: Bodi wants to be a rock \u2018n' roll star. Yet that means defying his father's wishes, heading to the city, and locating the legendary \u2014 and reclusive \u2014 musician Angus Scattergood (Eddie Izzard), who needs to write a new song and fast. If Bodi can put a band together, help Angus with his song, and defeat the wolves' plot to take Snow Mountain, his life will be in tune.
