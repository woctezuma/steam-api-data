The HD version is targeted towards modern computers that have DirectX 11 or DirectX 12 capabilities. You can select which game to play when you launch Steam. The top selection for Crystallo is the standard version, and the bottom selection is the HD version. Have fun and thank you again for playing our game! The full version of Crystallo only includes controller support. The demo uses mouse and keyboard.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nCrystallo is a Roll-A-Ball Adventure title in which you guide a sphere called Orbart. Your objective is to collect the key at the end of each level to advance through the game. Once you are at the last level (castle), your objective is to inform the kights of the wizard's plan to kidnap the princess. In each level, you can collide with certain objects like skeletons, barrels, and coins to increase your score. Watch out for spike traps as they will harm Orbart and increase your death counter. Each death will result in lost time as the countdown timer will not stop until it reaches 0. So, when you roll around to advance in each level try to avoid the traps that the wizard has set up for you. In this level, you will see checkpoint pillows placed that you can enter to save where Orbart can respawn at when you hit a trap. By doing so, it will make it to where you don't respawn back at the beginning of each level. The game starts with all levels locked except the first and credits scenes. Once you load the open level, you can then experience how the game works before deciding to purchase the game. Can you rescue the princess?",
