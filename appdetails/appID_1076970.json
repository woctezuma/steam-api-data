  "detailed_description": "Paco is a winged duck who, as the descendant of an ancient Inca dynasty, has the special privilege of hatching a fossilized dinosaur egg. He seems to be doing well, but then monkeys from Nazi Germany steal the egg to use genetic engineering to build a German \u201eWunderwaffe\u201c. Now it's up to our little duck Paco to save the world from Nazi-controlled dinosaurs.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAlthough this adventure carries many dangers, the carefully crafted world offers you the opportunity to immerse yourself in the atmosphere of the djungle, because a great inspiration for this game was Donkey Kong Country. Experience the subtle retro charm of the pixel world and the self-composed soundtracks.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nEssential features of the game are jump and run game mechanics. You can jump from platform to platform, but you should avoid the many traps, that are lurking for you. There are many ways to throw you back to the beginning of the level, unless you've reached a checkpoint before whether carnivorous plants, belligerent crocodiles, arrows or rolling boulders. In order to resist your opponents, there are tomatoes, coconuts, stones and bombs that you can throw. You also have a magical pan flute that lets you, for example, pause time, get clues, fly, or make a protective blister if you've made the necessary progress. All this awaits you in this game. Use your various skills to solve the puzzles and defeat your opponents.",
