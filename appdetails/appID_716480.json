  "detailed_description": "<h1>Early Beta Access</h1><p><u>Happy Halloween!</u><br>Hi, I'm Chris and I've been working feverishly to make this game and get it released on Halloween. Right now this game is just a glimpse of the vision that I have planned for it and I'm going to continue to work feverishly in the coming days and weeks to continue adding features and gameplay modes until my vision is fulfilled. <br><br>I may have missed the option during creating this store page to flag it as Beta, but I want to make it very clear that this game is still being worked on daily. I've made this game myself from scratch and I'm going to continue updating it regularly. The most important of those updates are...<br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Adding weapons</li><li>Adding Female character option</li><li>Adding the character class system</li><li>Adding Traps and Towers</li><li>Adding more Enemies</li><li>Adding more maps</li></ul><br>I'll always be tweaking animations and textures and creating more menus and options (like controller support). <br><br>This is a continued effort and I hope that you enjoy it. Thank you</p><br><h1>Update Notes</h1><p><strong>12/18 Update</strong><br><br>Hi everybody!<br>I've been working on quite a few things and getting ready for the Holidays. I hope you are all enjoying your Holiday season.<br>I added quite a bit in this update, but I still have a lot more coming. As always I appreciate your continued interest and support. I'm working on getting new screenshots and game play trailers made. Anything you want to post on the community page would be helpful. Here's a list of most of the things that I added in this update...<br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Goblins</li><li>Werewolves</li><li>Rotating Camera (q and e keys)</li><li>Destructible and Repairable fences (Left click on knocked over fences when near to repair)</li><li>Tweaks to gameplay (damage indicators and knock back, animations, and debugging)</li> </ul><br>As always there's a lot more to come and I'm working to get a lot ready for the Holiday break. Thanks again!<br><br>-Chris</p><br><h1>About the Game</h1>Halloween Knight is a hack n' slash adventure game mixed with tower defenses where you try to protect your house on Halloween night.
