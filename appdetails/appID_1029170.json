Use your perfectly timed defence to reflect enemy attacks, or a well-timed evasion to create an opening that bypasses the enemy's guard so that you can hit them where it hurts!<br><br>The system now rewards wise weapon selection; heavy weapon users will be more rewarded for mastering defence and breaking enemy guard by sheer force, while players using faster weapons will need to employ evasive manoeuvres to follow up on openings. Clash with your enemy as your attacks meet; cancelling both, or in the case of heavy weapons; cause glancing damage to wear down the enemy, or read the enemy's move and attack from the opposite direction to parry them and open them up for a devastating follow-up.<br><br>Use the new <strong>Tension</strong> bar to unleash special skills related to your weapon class; build tension passively throughout the fight, or raise it faster by carrying out well-timed actions. These skills will allow you to further enhance your move-set and specialise to your liking. Upgrade your weapons by up to 20 levels; unlocking tension skills and raising their stats.<br><br>Level your stats through use. Instead of general exp, each of your 11 stats will increase naturally through use in battle; taking a lot of hard knocks and direct hits will make you tougher, become consistently adept at avoiding attacks and you will level up evasion, swing your favourite weapon type around enough and you will become more efficient at it; causing more damage whilst costing less guard.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Exploration:</h2><br>Forge your own path in a single, deeply interconnected <strong>Metroidvania</strong> light world. Shortcuts, loops, and a tightly woven world await as you explore the Imperial palace; an ominous place with its intimate surroundings and the eldritch secrets that lie below.

Pick your path and your battles; the world features a semi-open design with multiple paths to your objective, as well as tons of secrets to uncover.

It is here that you will attempt to fulfil your mission and recover a very special item for which the survival of the entire Empire hinges on.
