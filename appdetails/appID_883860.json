Well, that's what I've been told to do. <br><br>Stranger things happened in Green Pine Town lately! Something doesn't belong to this world came out of nowhere. Dark shadows fly through the nightsky with street lamps dispelling unease light. Pumpkins with scary faces show up all over the place. It's really hard to tell what kind of people would be into that kind of thing. Anyway, the townfolk calls it Jack O'Lantern. What a weird name!<br><br>Rumors said there were even customers with transparent bodies patronaging the most renowned item shop in town. How many were they? Five? I guess. I'll leave it to you. I don't really have much time lurking in the night alone.<br><br>Oh right, Carnival. Who cares about it? Just some blueprints and decos prepared for people whoever in need. BORING!<br><br>There's one more thing. Have you heard about the MANSION? I can assure you there are nothing like a mysterious beautiful housekeeper living in it. And I have no idea her name is GRACE. If you manage to collect all the 7 Halloween equipments for her, a GHOST outfit will be unlocked. Oops! Forget about it. It was just a slip of the tongue.<br><br>Am I spoiling too much? Uh-huh! There's even more! Bloodbat Priest Lynn, Demon Knight Carel, Dark Guardian Farune and GHOST outfits for some heroes. Of course. There's something for you and your partner. Halloween dressings and Halloween Gacha will be sure to make you satisfied. <br><br>ALRIGHT! ALRIGHT! It's time to call it a NIGHT. Until next time!</p><br><h1>About the Game</h1>In a land of myth and magic the destiny of Cadria rests on the brave warriors. Well. It\u2019s too risky to save the world yourself. Never mind.
