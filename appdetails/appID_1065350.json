You know, like a normal person.  But you\u2019re a Grand Master, and you don\u2019t follow those rules. One button is all it takes to beat these pesky ninjas, and the goal is to do this every single day. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis is another humble Beat-Fu game which has a lot of playability, and loads of fun.
