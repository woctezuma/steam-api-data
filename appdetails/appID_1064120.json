  "reviews": "\u201cI found a suspected thief in a room. I'll brook no thieves outside of myself, so I promptly murdered him. Unfortunately, I missed the guard in the corner of the room, so I had to murder him too. Thing is, no one else heard my bloody hacking, so I quietly climbed out the back window. Later in my demo, I was told that the crime was discovered, but it wasn't quite pinned on me yet.\u201d<br><a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=https://www.usgamer.net/articles/the-10-best-indies-of-pax-east-2019\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >USGamer</a><br><br>\u201cConsequences to your actions loom around every corner, and I'm excited to see just how dynamic the game can get.\u201d<br><a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/15-fascinating-new-games-that-shouldnt-be-overlook/2900-2660/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >Gamespot</a><br><br>\u201cThis town would always remember the day when the two gangs\u2019 leadership were killed \u2013 the day their town was saved.
