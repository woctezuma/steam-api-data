  "reviews": "\u201cIts unique gameplay and immersive atmosphere felt like a breath of fresh air with regards to what games can do. We. The Revolution has been on the outskirts of my radar for a while due to its distinct art style and an interesting concept on paper, but not much beyond said art has been seen. Now a little under a month before release, we have a look at how the gameplay is going to work. From what I've seen, it should tick a lot of my boxes.\u201d<br><a href=\"https://www.destructoid.com/heads-roll-in-we-the-revolution-s-first-gameplay-trailer-544228.phtml\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\"  >Destructoid</a><br><br>\u201cIt's a gorgeous looking game and its mechanics are very pleasing, but I honestly can't remember the last time a game had quite such an oppressive atmosphere. Impressive and upsetting in equal measure, it's really stuck with me in the days since I played it and I'm still not quite sure how to feel about it - or about the choices I made during my play time. It's one to watch, I think, but only for those with the stomach for it.\u201d<br><a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2018-09-04-we-the-revolution-is-a-horribly-queasy-game-about-life-and-death?fbclid=IwAR0Kk1jcPHoIZvVshv4QrDeRlbCXO3cdfiWldQCG92caIkmHb6MywfT_WgQ\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >Eurogamer</a><br><br>\u201c(...)from the vantage point of something like a visual novel, we get far more emotional depth and meaningful maturity than we do from so many splashy, big budget operations.\u201d<br><a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/326172/Opinion_The_dark_allure_of_We_The_Revolution.php?utm_source=dlvr.it&amp;utm_medium=facebook&amp;utm_campaign=gamasutra&amp;fbclid=IwAR2wseMwDCni0T2bxpBqgvjgP5QkdI1s4T2FpmaYjGIIjOM7-m7pjC7UeTM\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >Gamasutra</a><br>",
