You play the role of a riftwalker in a scouting party sent to investigate a nearby missing star, but find more than you were expecting - a civilization, or rather, what's left of it. It's your job to find out what happened and make sure the threat never spreads to your world.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Features</h2>Tower Defense like you've never seen before!

The story is almost complete, however, I will only be introducing the story fragments once I've polished up the game-play some more and released the upgrade tree as they will integrate with the upgrade tree. In the meantime, there are clues to the story everywhere - without going into specific detail. The environment is being designed with the story in mind.
