That\u2019s right! Take a tour to the junkyard, or an action house and buy a car, motorcycle, airplane or even a train (if you have enough money of course).

If that\u2019s not enough for your needs, you can always switch to some more finesse tools such as hammer or an angle cutter to give your vehicle a desired shape.
