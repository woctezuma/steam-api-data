Expect the unexpected as this clown takes you through a world of imagination. <br><br>In Ayo\u2019s hometown, things are generally peaceful.

You\u2019ll find out along this incredible adventure as you struggle to reunite clown and dog. Like all good adventures, you won\u2019t be all on your own.

Don\u2019t be fooled by Ayo\u2019s handsome look! <br></li><li><strong>Arsenals-</strong> Tank, helicopter, toy hammer, balloon sword, water balloon, you name it. They can break open hidden places and extinguish fire...etc.<br></li><li><strong>Skills-</strong> head stomp, wall jump, slope slide, and many more~<br></li><li><strong> Side Quests-</strong> Plenty of side quests you can take on in Town or along the journey, be prepared for surprising rewards.
