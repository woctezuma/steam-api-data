Accompanied by his best friend Devin Roberts (Jai Courtney), a hard-nosed Marine whose natural instinct is to shoot first and ask questions later, he searches desperately for the whereabouts of his estranged son, Johnathan (Charlie Shotwell), and wife Natalie (Kate Mara). In their search, the two intercept Charles (Clifton Collins Jr.), a man carrying vital information about the whereabouts of Gabriel's family. As we revisit the past, we are guided through the unraveling of the puzzle of Gabriel's experience, and what will eventually lead us to finding his family. A psychological suspense thriller, MAN DOWN also stars Gary Oldman.",
