Super Sexy Software started in spirit in 2013, when the first echoes of The Shattering started to take form. The project began from studying the contrast of white and black in horror and culture. The core theme draws on the premise that horrors and fear can be achieved through embracing white and the absence of information, rather than darkness and the obvious, though unseen, enemy.<br><br>Over various iterations, the game took shape and the decision was made to work on it in every spare moment that could be found. With members of the team residing in Poland, France and Switzerland, they grew in experience and efficiency as the true spirit of the studio was born. As the game progressed, the developers and Deck13 met at a networking event and the synergy between the companies resonated immediately. A publisher was found, and all the ingredients to finish The Shattering were ready.<br><br>With the full development spanning multiple years, births and deaths, tears and laughter, the only joy greater than that of the journey together as one team and family, is the joy of seeing The Shattering take shape and be played by people around the world.
