It has plenty of ghostly towers, most notably in Cawdor Castle. However, Alabama native Allen Hammack was probably instead referring to the Inverness neighborhood in Birmingham.

It was run as the AD&amp;D tournament at Wintercon VIII (1979) and afterward was sold to con-goers in a limited edition run of 300 copies. That short run was labeled &quot;Collector's Edition II,&quot; presumably following the &quot;Collector's Edition&quot; of the &quot;Tamoachan&quot; adventure. C2 was released to the wider public the next year, in 1980.<br><br>Also like its predecessor, &quot;Ghost Tower&quot; was one of the first adventures to show how a tournament was run. It includes pre-generated characters, rules for scoring tournament play, and a handful of visual aids which were again some of the earliest player handouts in the industry.<br><br><strong>Recurring Tropes.</strong> James Maliszewski calls C2 a &quot;funhouse dungeon,&quot; which is more about spectacular, weird, and crazy encounters than about a dungeon ecology that actually works. Module S2: &quot;White Plume Mountain&quot; (1979) is a previous example of the same approach.<br><br><strong>Future History.</strong> The RPGA returned to Inverness in 3e with their Living Greyhawk core special adventure, &quot;Return to the Ghost Tower&quot; (2003).
