You will enjoy precisely reconstructed battles over the ground and ocean, photorealistic locations, and footage of historical chronicles. <br><br>The P-38 Lightning is a significant representative of the US Army Air Force, a heavy fighter with an unusual twin-boom tail. With its ability to fly for up to 3600 km (2237 mi), they were often used for bomber escort missions or reconnaissance. These aircraft were used by some of the most effective US ace pilots - Richard Ira Bong with 40 victories and Thomas McGuire with 38 victories for example. The Model G of the P-38 has more powerful engines than the earlier series and is armed with a nose mounted 20-mm cannon and four 0.50 machineguns which allow for very precise accuracy. <br><br>The A6M5 Ko. was one of the latest and the most advanced models of the legendary Zero naval fighter. It was the fastest modification with a top speed of 565 km/h, but with the same agility. No other plane can \u201coutturn\u201d a Zero in game apart from biplanes, so in horizontal maneuvers the A6M5 Ko has no rival. <br>Just like all premium vehicles, the XP-38G and the A6M5 Ko will earn more Research Points and Silver Lions for each battle and comes already furnished with all the available improvements. <br><br>Just like all premium vehicles, the XP-38G and A6M5 Ko allow you to earn increased Research Points and Silver Lions for each battle and come furnished with all available modifications. <br><br>With a Premium account (also purchasable in the game for Golden Eagles) you will earn more Research Points and Silver Lions during each battle for a set amount of days. <strong>This is cumulative with bonuses from premium vehicles!</strong><br><br><br><br><strong>Attention!</strong>Available for Linux, Windows and Mac only.
