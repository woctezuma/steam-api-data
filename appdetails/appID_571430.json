Countless hours have gone into perfecting the steering. The drone aligns with the rotation of your hand, and pushing the trigger cranks up the power. Don't worry, a tutorial will guide you through the basics, and with a bit of practice you'll buzz around the room in no time.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">BINAURAL AUDIO</h2>Steam Audio is used to leverage HRTF-based binaural rendering. This refers to a way of recreating how a sound is affected by a listener's head, ears, and torso, resulting in subtle cues that allow you to pinpoint exactly where a sound is coming from.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">CHALLENGES</h2>You'll discover 25 unique levels packed with lasers, heat-seeking missiles and other dangers. You fly through the checkpoints as fast as you can -- the faster the higher the score. You can get up to 3 stars on each level, but you'll have to work hard because it's exclusive to the best players.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">LOCAL MULTIPLAYER</h2>Wanna play with friends, family or colleagues? Drone Hero offers local multiplayer using pass-and-play. All players will be put through a set of random challenges. You'll all fight, but there will only be one winner.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">GLOBAL LEADERBOARD</h2>Climb to fame on the global leaderboard. It's updated live, so as soon as you pass someone, they'll know.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">ATMOSPHERE</h2>You'll feel surrounded by light because the room is packed with bright lights that change color and synchronize with the pumping bass.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">SEIZURE WARNING</h2>A small percentage of people may experience a seizure when exposed to certain visual images, including flashing lights or patterns. Immediately stop playing and consult a doctor if you experience any symptoms.",
