This strange dream-poem would become known as &quot;Childe Roland To The Dark Tower Came,&quot; considered by many to be one of the greatest works of poetry in the English language.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">This is a personal interpretation of that poem.</h2><br>I first read this masterpiece during a very difficult time in my life, and I want to share some of the beauty and insight I gained from it. To achieve this end, I have illustrated, animated, or otherwise represented each line in the format of a &quot;visual novel,&quot; to best show you what I see in my mind's eye when reading it. Hopefully you can gain something of use, or perhaps just beauty, from this experience.<br><br>Yours,<br>-Yitz",
