The Arma 3 Creator DLC program enables selected outside developers to publish original new content for Arma 3 as commercial DLC on Steam. The proceeds of the Arma 3 Creator DLC: Global Mobilization - Cold War Germany are shared between the developers of this DLC (Vertexmacht), the publisher (Bohemia Interactive), and the digital distributor (Valve).</p><br><h1>About the Game</h1>Willkommen! It's time for you to return to the Cold War. With its bombastic amounts of new original content, the Global Mobilization - Cold War Germany Creator DLC for Arma 3 invites you to live and breathe the military conflict between the two Germanies in the 1980s. Ride into armored combat against a determined enemy that easily outnumbers you. Experience warfare from the perspective of infantry reinforced with APCs. Or breach the historic inner German border to force the enemy\u2019s hand in battle. Which side of the wall will you fight for? Besides the West and East German armies, this DLC pack also includes Denmark as a smaller but viable military faction.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Key Features</h2><br><strong>Weferlingen Terrain</strong><br>Located in the northern plains of Germany, Weferlingen offers the largest Arma terrain released so far: 419 square kilometers of usable area. It's modeled after a real-world location in 1983, and uses entirely new assets \u2013 providing you with a unique experience that gives Arma 3 an entirely fresh look and feel. Explore nearly 50 fully destructible settlements in both West and East Germany, prepare your ambushes from scattered wooded areas, or have tanks battle each other at great distances on farmland \u2013 with each presenting its own major challenges.<br><br>The Weferlingen terrain is also available in a special winter variant. After all, the Cold War should stay cold. Each of the available multiplayer scenarios can be played on this version of the terrain as well.<br><br>In addition, be sure to check out the terrain\u2019s largest dominating feature: the inner German border \u2013 a part of the famous Iron Curtain that was faithfully recreated using formerly classified documents. As a result, the Weferlingen terrain lets you take Arma 3 and turn it into a digital museum.<br><br><br><strong>42 Vehicles &amp; Vehicle Variants</strong><br>Pitting the Federal Republic of Germany (West Germany) against the German Democratic Republic (East Germany), you will encounter 42 new vehicle assets on the battlefield:<br><br><i>West Germany</i><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>KPz 1A1A1 and KPz 1A3 Main Battle Tanks<br></li><li>M113 series of tracked Armoured Personnel Carriers in various roles<br></li><li>TPz 1 series of wheeled Armoured Personnel Carriers in various roles<br></li><li>FlakPz 1A1 Self Propelled Anti Aircraft platform<br></li><li>BPz 2A0 recovery tank<br></li><li>0.5t Truck as fast attack vehicle and transporter<br></li><li>2t Truck in transport, medical and supply variants<br></li><li>5t Truck in transport and support roles<br></li><li>10t Truck heavy transporter<br></li><li>K125 Motorcycle</li></ul><br><i>East Germany</i><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>T-55A Main Battle Tank<br></li><li>BMP-1 SP2 tracked Armoured Personnel Carrier<br></li><li>SPW-60 series of wheeled Armoured Personnel Carriers in various roles<br></li><li>SPW-40 scout vehicle and command post variant<br></li><li>ZSU-23-4V1 Self Propelled Anti Aircraft platform<br></li><li>Truck 5 series in transport, tractor and supply variants<br></li><li>Truck 5 Mp series in three support roles</li></ul><br><i>Civilian</i><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>P601, a car produced in East Germany (also available as police patrol)<br></li><li>Typ 1200, a car produced in West Germany (also available as police patrol)<br></li><li>Bicycle</li></ul><br><br><strong>21 Weapons</strong><br>Carry 21 timeless classic weapons (including weapon variants) into battle:<br><br><i>West Germany</i><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>G3 Battle Rifle and variants<br></li><li>MG3 Machine Gun<br></li><li>MP2A1 Submachine Gun<br></li><li>PzF 44 Anti Tank Rocket Launcher<br></li><li>PzF 84 Heavy Anti Tank Rocket Launcher<br></li><li>Anti Tank Guided Missile Launcher<br></li><li>P1 Handgun<br></li><li>P2A1 Flare Gun</li></ul><br><i>East Germany</i><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>KM-72 (East German-made AK-47) Assault Rifle and variants<br></li><li>AK-74 Assault Rifle and variants<br></li><li>RPK Light Machine Gun<br></li><li>RPK-74 Light Machine Gun<br></li><li>PKM Machine Gun<br></li><li>RPG-7 Anti Tank Rocket Launcher<br></li><li>Fagot Anti Tank Guided Missile Launcher<br></li><li>PM Handgun<br></li><li>LP-1 Flare Gun</li></ul><br>All of the relevant optics and binoculars are also included. <br><br><br><strong>More Infantry Clothing &amp; Gear</strong><br>Global Mobilization: Cold War Germany introduces various new character assets:<br><br><i>West Germany</i><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Summer, Autumn, and Winter Field Suits<br></li><li>Tank Crew Overall<br></li><li>Bundesgrenzschutz Field Suit<br></li><li>Police Officer Uniform<br></li><li>Police Patrol Uniform<br></li><li>Firefighter and Postman Suit<br></li><li>Standard Issue Compass</li></ul><br><i>East Germany</i><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Summer and Winter Field Service Suits<br></li><li>Tank Suit<br></li><li>Officer Dress Uniform<br></li><li>Police Officer Uniform<br></li><li>Standard Issue Compass</li></ul><br><i>Denmark</i><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Summer and Winter Combat Suits</li></ul><br>The uniforms come with all of the helmets, hats, vests, and backpacks that are needed to equip the faction's soldiers for all situations.
