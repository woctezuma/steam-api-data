We wanted to make the game different from other spaceshooters by limiting your ability to shoot. The only way you can replenish your ammo is by absorbing asteroids or enemies, but be aware that absorbing enemies comes at a cost, it takes out some of your energy.<br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1068990/extras/AbsorbGifSteam.gif?t=1560264078\" ><br><br>     Another key mechanic is the teleport. By not using the classic portrait view of different spaceshooters you are left with more room in which to move. To traverse this space more quickly or to dodge enemy attacks you can use the teleport. This also takes out a small portion of your energy.<br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1068990/extras/TeleportGifSteam.gif?t=1560264078\" ><br><br>     Last but not least, the most clasic mechanic in all spaceshooters, you can shoot down all the enemies on screen by using your ammo.<br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1068990/extras/ShootingGifSteam.gif?t=1560264078\" ><br><br>     After you complete a sector you will be rewarded with an upgrade point.
