Being inventive will also help, as cleverness often triumphs over brute force in Starbase, and the only limitation is the creativity of the players.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Early Access</h2><br>Starbase Early Access will introduce the players, the pioneers, to a new galaxy that they can begin to explore from a bunch of huge stations, the Mega Stations, located at the orbit of a single planet. As the players eventually settle the entire orbit, they can start finding ways to travel to the planet\u2019s moons and someday all the way to other planets and distant star systems.
