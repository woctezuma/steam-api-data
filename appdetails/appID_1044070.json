  "reviews": "\u201cWithin several minutes of playing, I knew this would be one of the 5 apps I would actually go back to.\u201d<br>9.5/10 \u2013 iPwnAge<br><br>\u201cWhat I love about Monster Crush is that it involves a lot of strategy, and unlike other puzzle games where you just randomly place objects to see what happens.\u201d<br>4.5/5 \u2013 <a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=https://pocketfullofapps.com/2010/04/05/monster-crush-review.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >https://pocketfullofapps.com/2010/04/05/monster-crush-review.html</a><br><br>\u201cThe real magic of Monster Crush is in its ability to be one part strategic puzzle with an equal part of fun physics toy. Replaying levels for new solutions or better outcomes quickly becomes dangerously addictive. With so much to do and enjoy, this is a must try game.\u201d<br>4/5 \u2013 <a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://www.appspy.com/review/3810/monster-crush-demolition-review\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >http://www.appspy.com/review/3810/monster-crush-demolition-review</a><br>",
