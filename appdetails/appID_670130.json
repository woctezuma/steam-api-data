  "reviews": "\u201cBrilliant - this is all assisted stuff, no musical talent required, but boy does it make you feel like you have some! The VR options are nicely considerate to play space and making the choices is just immensely fun and diverting. We've had amazing fun with this, super creative and it's really great pass-n-play with mates too. I'm off now to buy the Phineas and Ferb DLC for my 10 yr old. Keep up the great start devs!\u201d<br />\r\nLegoknockingshop<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\u201cCreativity without screwing up! This is a unique take on a music game that lets you create music but guarantees that it harmonizes. There's a huge variety of instruments and musical genres, making it a lot of fun to mix and match, trying out different combinations. It's fun to play and I really enjoyed the environments and VR elements, like the instrument selections and floating notes.\u201d<br />\r\nwfthornton<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\u201cJam Studio is truly an outstanding game. And I definitely recommend it to anyone that has a love for music. I play multiple VR games on a daily basis, and I got the privilege to beta test this game and see it improve tremendously over time. There is nothing better than kicking back after a long day and making songs and beats to all the different varieties of music this game offers. The instruments are awesome and look great. I usually play mainly action games but there's something different about this game that gets you hooked and want to come back. To top it off they have a minigame that allows you to play while listening to the song/beat that you created. The developers really outdid themselves with all the different features this game brings to the table. As I said before if you have a passion for music then this game is a MUST HAVE. Great work overall by the developing team.\u201d<br />\r\nAblaine19<br />\r\n",
