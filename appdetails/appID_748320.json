He is catapulted into an extraordinary adventure where he must save his pet cat, \u2018Mr Dirty Paws\u2019, and bring colour back to the surreal feline world. Along the way he meets all manner of cats. Some try to use him to do their bidding, some want him dead and use all manner of deception to end his life.
