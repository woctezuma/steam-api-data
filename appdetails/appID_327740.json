Added .NET 3.5 Client Profile redistributable. \r\n\r\n10/20/2014 Build (415656)\r\n\r\n\u2022\tAdded TronLauncher.exe to resolve a compatibility issue with the cloud save.\r\n\r\n10/15/2014 Build (411009)\r\n\r\n\u2022\tFixed disc check error appearing when there is no optical drive present.\r\n\u2022\tThe game no longer resets user preferences each time it is launched.</p><br><h1>About the Game</h1>Alan Bradley has finally perfected the technology to digitize people, which allows humans to enter the internal world of a computer. His program, &quot;&quot;Ma3a,&quot;&quot; has AI sophisticated enough to store the entire gene code of a person and the mathematical equations necessary to transfer people back and forth between the physical and digital world.\r\n\r\nHowever, fCon -- Future Control Industries -- has learned of Alan's research and is moving to take over the company. When Alan disappears mysteriously, finding him is up to Jet, his son. Jet uses his father's technology to enter the computer world and, while investigating his father's disappearance, discovers a sinister plot.\r\n\r\nFour &quot;&quot;primitive&quot;&quot; weapons -- disk, rod, ball, and mesh -- are encountered in the computer world, though the disk is the only weapon that can be used both offensively and defensively. Jet will also ride light-cycles, both the classic cycle from the 1982 film and a new &quot;&quot;experimental&quot;&quot; update from designer Syd Mead (also responsible for the original light-cycle design).",
