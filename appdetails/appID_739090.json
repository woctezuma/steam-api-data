Sail on ancient seas, explore unknown worlds, and witness one of the world\u2019s most important ancient sites. Experience it now!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nLithodomos VR has painstakingly recreated ancient Ephesus, allowing you to step back in time and explore the city in all of its original splendour and glory. You are a sailor in the 2nd Century AD, and your mission is to deliver precious goods - but your ship is off course, and you must first steer it safely into the harbour. Be careful along the way: piracy is well known in the Roman world.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis Lithodomos VR experience is not just engaging and entertaining, but is a valuable educational tool of great historical significance. Every detail has been researched and approved and is backed-up by archaeological evidence. If you can\u2019t travel to Turkey, or travel back in time, then this is the most important cultural experience you can have.",
