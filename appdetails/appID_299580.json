  "detailed_description": "Abducted is a 3rd person action-adventure game using the latest Unreal 4 technology.  Created by former Battlefield and Borderlands developer Richard Cowgill, Abducted is truly out of this world.<br><br>Abducted is a game with focus on a complex storyline, immersive gameplay as well as a mixture of classic adventure game and RPG-lite mechanics.  It spans a wide range of gameplay types and environments, everything from a linear corridor type of experience to open world, non-linear gameplay.  You can expect plot twists, surprises, and an unconventionally told story with deeper, underlying meanings.<br><br>Abducted draws its inspiration from classic adventure games and modernizes these ideas.  If you like any form of story driven adventure game Abducted is for you.<br><br>Keep in mind, this is Early Access.  While the game is very far along in development and the whole game is there, several elements are not yet finished.  And bugs do exist, it is not yet ready to be stress tested.<br><br><strong><u>Gameplay &amp; Mechanics</u></strong><br><br><strong>The Arm</strong><br>One of the most interesting and mysterious things you will do is interact with an alien computer embedded in your arm, which we simply call \u201cThe Arm.\u201d Why and how the computer got there is a critical element of the story.<br><br>The Arm computer is your primary source of guidance and information. In truth, it\u2019s your only friend and ally in an otherwise baffling and inhospitable world. You interact with your Arm computer by having conversations with it. We have developed a directed free-form conversation system that allows for near endless discussions. In Abducted the flow of conversation is player-driven and not predetermined. This is very different from games such as Mass Effect or Star Wars Knights Of the Old Republic where conversions are fixed in their structure.<br><br>What does this mean for you as the player? It means that you can discover things through conversation in a very dynamic way. You may uncover information about your environment that gives you interesting backstory, unlocks a new ability or upgrade, or even saves your life. However, you are never forced to use The Arm. You can have deep hour long conversations with it or you can ignore it entirely.<br><br><strong>The Dreamscape</strong><br>The Dreamscape is the realm all around you, think of it as the world of metadata that you can't physically see.  But using your Dreamscape ability, you can leave your physical body and explore this realm free-form.  The aliens who made this place, whoever they were, left you all manner of clues and information to be discovered.  By exploring the Dreamscape you can solve puzzles, gain critical information and learn things you otherwise couldn't in human form.<br><br><strong>Manipulate</strong><br>In Abducted the environment can be \u201cmanipulated\u201d (moved) by the player. Manipulating objects is a mysterious power that The Arm gives to the player.<br><br>Some objects in the environment are deadly unless they are restrained from moving. Manipulate can be used to solve puzzles, defensively to create safe areas, or to otherwise save your life.  In some cases it can be used to open new paths and hidden locations.<br><br><strong>Pulse</strong><br>Your Arm can fire a bolt of energy that will obliterate anything in its path. It is a scary and often unwieldy weapon that if left charging too long has the potential to explode, killing you and anything unlucky enough to be in the vicinity.<br><br>Pulse and your other abilities will gain upgrades during the course of the story that are narrative-driven.  These upgrades stay with you and open up new areas and possibilities.<br><br><strong>Shield</strong><br>The alien technology that inhabits your body can generate a close quarters force field that can protect you from incoming attacks.  In some cases the Shield will be the difference between life and death.  Like Pulse, as the story progresses new abilities will unlock allowing you to do things you otherwise didn't think were possible.<br><br><strong>Exploration</strong><br>In Abducted exploration is a mechanic in and of itself. The player has to combine critical thinking and his/her other abilities to successfully explore and travel through the environment without being injured or killed in the process.<br><br>Sometimes exploration and progression involves run-and-gun intense action where you must use your Shield and Pulse abilities to blast your way through flesh-eating bugs as big as your head. Death in Abducted doesn\u2019t just happen from being eaten. It can also come from all manner of environment hazards.<br><br><strong>Uncompromising Art</strong><br>We may be indie, but we don\u2019t intend on looking like it. Sunside uses advanced 3D techniques that are typically employed in modern AAA games, but we do this more rapidly and with lower cost than big studios. One example of this is our main heroine of the story.<br><br><strong>Music and Sound FX</strong><br>Music and sound effects are extremely important to our environment. We have partnered with Voodoo Highway Music to produce all our music and sound for Abducted, and they have already created a large volume of amazing content for us. The result will be a game that is extremely immersive and environmental.",
