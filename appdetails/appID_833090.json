Fighters come from all over of their own free will to risk their lives against man or beast!!!! Fight to the death all to experience the thrill of victory - and if defeated to die for glory! <br><br>Gurrah is a single player and multiplayer online game. It takes skill beyond typical gaming to keep up: swing, slice, slash, dodge, duck, and destroy. VR does amazing things to bring life-like hand-to-hand combat into your home.<br><br><strong>The Weapons:</strong><br>These high-tech weapons were forged using nano chip technology. The weapons are designed with the illusion of light weight but actually have the momentum and weight of their ancestor's. Gurrah has a wide selection of weapons: one hand swords, shields, glaives, spears, axes, heavy-class swords, double-sided sabers, daggers, and throwing stars. Select and train, the choice is yours! <br><br><br><strong>The Beasts:</strong><br>The arena presents many threats to keep gladiators on their toes. Fully armored bulls, tigers, hydras and more are ready for battle. Bred and bio-engineered to fight with ferocity.  Each beast presents a new challenge, testing the ability of a warrior to adjust on the fly. The crowd must be entertained!",
