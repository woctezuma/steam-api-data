It allows you to play the game fully online, as much as you like! And you can even start progressing through the game, earning items and animal DNA. These cosmetic items you earn in the Super Free Edition are locked, so you won't be able to create new Super Animals or dress them up to make them your own, but if you like the game and choose to purchase it, all of your items and progress you've earned will transfer right into the full game! That's pretty <i>Super,</i> right? Hopefully not so super that you'll avoid supporting development of the game, but we're really proud of what we've built and the community that has grown around it, so we hope that giving you the chance to experience it for yourself will show you that it's an Early Access game worth supporting!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Constantly evolving, refined gameplay:</strong></h2><br>The top down view and streamlined mechanics make this the most accessible battle royale yet, while surprisingly deep strategy and a high skill cap rewards more advanced players. The game has also been optimized to run smoothly whether you play on a Macbook or a beastly gaming PC.<br><br>The island and roster of genetically engineered super animals are constantly (ahem) <i>evolving</i> with updates. Your super animal can be customized with new outfits, tombstones, death explosions, weapons, dance moves, and more, so you can look your best as you do your worst.<br><br>Join us in Super Animal World to see what we're building with our Early Access community and contribute to the game's development!",
