  "detailed_description": "<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Thief Simulator</strong></h2><br>Become the real thief. Observe your target and gather information that will help you with the burglary. Take the challenge and rob the best secured houses. Buy some hi-tech burglar equipement and learn new thief tricks. Sell stolen goods to the passers and avoid too much attention from the police. Do anything that a real thief does!<br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/704850/extras/01en.png?t=1522960049\" ><br><br>A good thief always observes his target. What's inside? Who lives there? What's your target day schedule? Find out when the house is empty and does it have nosy neighbours. Check if their dog chooses dog snacks over the bone. Dress as a courier or a cop to investigate your target even better. Choose from lots of possible approaches to prepare the best plan. Many modern devices available in Thief Simulator might come in handy with gathering intel about your target and it's neighbourhood.<br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/704850/extras/02en.png?t=1522960049\" ><br><br>The faster, the better. Find and steal as many valuables as possible in the shortest time possible. Remember that infinite backpacks don't exist. When it's about time you have to maintain cold blood. In every house you'll find tons of useless stuff, which can really slow you down. If you're not shure that you can take some serious money for it, maybe a good idea would be to leave it behind and save space for some expensive goods. If you fill your backpack with worthless items, you may have to waste your time to throw stuff out just to make space for other things. Be careful, cause some things can draw police attention to you!<br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/704850/extras/03en.png?t=1522960049\" ><br><br>A real, experienced thief can spot places where there's most probability of finding some valuables on the fly. Use the scanner to highlight all the valuables in sight and places where you can expect them to be. Remember that you can use it only few times during burglary and that it has a limited range. <br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/704850/extras/04en.png?t=1522960049\" ><br><br>Get rid of stuff that can lead cops on your track. Turn off the GPS trackers, disconnect all the devices from the internet and erase serial numbers. Disassemblement of an car is expensive, but if it's a rare model, spending a few dollars may save you a few years in prison. Some of the goods you can sell without investing money in getting rid of tracks, but ultimately the decision is yours. Remember, that if you dont remain careful, cops will eventually knock on your door.<br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/704850/extras/05en.png?t=1522960049\" ><br><br>Look around for any useful items. They will save you some time on lockpicking or hacking. Keys, notes with passwords to the alarm systems, or even fridge magnets. All those things can look useless, but can also make life of an aspiring thief so much easier and reduce your burglary time even by a half. Of course many of them are just useless trash... Or maybe they aren't?<br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/704850/extras/06en.png?t=1522960049\" ><br><br>Be careful! In some houses you can meet unexpected guests. If they catch you in the act, your memory portrait will be on every pole in the city. This will seriously impact your intel possibilities and reduce the trading capabilities. <br><br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/704850/extras/07en.png?t=1522960049\" ><br><br>Design your own house. Build a fortress and put it to the test with the Thief Simulator editor. Choose from alarm systems and security devices you've already seen to make potential thief's life a little harder. Get yourself a dog or two. Surround your house with the electrical fence. It all depends on your imagination and wallet of course. See if others can rob you!<br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/704850/extras/08en.png?t=1522960049\" ><br><br>Find your neighbour's house or build it yourself, and find out if it's easy to rob. Make a bet with frend about who robs the other one first, or join forces, build an unconquerable fortress and put it to the test by sharing it with other players.",
