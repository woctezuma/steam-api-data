Soon enough the fear grew even stronger after the terrorists have made contact. They want ten billion Euro in 24 hours or they will blow up the entire Chernobyl nuclear power plant, releasing clouds of deadly, radioactive materials high into the atmosphere all over the northern hemisphere. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nTo pay such amount of money to the extremists is unthinkable. Frontal attack, however, could not be thought about, either - the terrorists would have executed their plan if they saw attacking forces. There were too many of them and too well equipped for a quick military operation to succeed. <br />\r\nOne possibility remained - to select the best Spec Ops single unit to sneak in and destroy enemy installation, preventing them from blowing up the Chernobyl and killing as many of them as possible. One man.
