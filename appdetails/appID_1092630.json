Develop your character each run with random items ranging from incremental stat modifiers to lethal showers of bullets. Expand your arsenal to include the full range of items Rogue Glitch has to offer by leveling up; then crush bosses to access unique glitched versions of your former self. <br><br><br><strong>Play solo or up to four players to conquer the glitchworld.</strong><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Features</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Solo play and online/local co-op<br></li><li>More than 80 unique items to collected<br></li><li>Seven character variants each with upgrading stats and skins<br></li><li>A narrative told through completion events<br></li><li>Four difficulties to challenge you and your friends</li></ul><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Movement</h2>Fluid movement is the core component to making a platforming focused roguelite. Auto-targeting projectiles will fire as you remain within proximity of enemies and a downward stomp allows you increase your damage output. Learn the different enemy types and behaviours to achieve a devastating finesse in combat.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Progression</h2>Rogue Glitch is packed with unlockable items, characters and cosmetics to make every run a worthwhile one. Experience is awarded based on performance which will provide random item unlocks on level-ups. Bosses drop a currency called Malbytes which can be used to upgrade your existing characters into more powerful evolutions. Finally, each completion of a run will progress the story with a mysterious lovable villain, earning the new character variants.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Story</h2>You were once a regular platforming character, running, jumping and shooting in your little 2D world. However things are starting to get weird. Your levels are being scrambled, pick-ups modified, and enemies mutating, The origins of these happenings are unclear but you are curious enough to proceed deeper into the unknown. You meet an ominous being who wants to make a deal...<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">The Future</h2>Rogue Glitch was created for quick iteration and evolution. More items and characters are already on the way but we're excited to hear your ideas for glitched entities to distort your game. Leave your suggestions in the Community Hub to help evolve Rogue Glitch throughout 2019. For more information on Early Access, read above this section.",
