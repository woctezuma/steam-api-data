  "detailed_description": "Runes: The Forgotten Path is an immersive action-fantasy game designed from the ground up for new VR devices such as the HTC Vive and Oculus Rift. Runes is a VR adventure set in a fantasy world in which you play as a renegade wizard. You will master the art of spellcasting by drawing rune shapes in the air with your hands.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nYou will play as Leth, a powerful wizard trying to escape from the Oblivion, a magical sleep prison of the mind. Astray from the path of righteousness and trapped inside yourself by the tyrannical order of the Panopticon, you will have to face a blank beginning. With the use of your powerful spells and wits you will fight enemies, solve puzzles and pursue the recollection of all your lost memories. But are you alone? <br />\r\n<br />\r\nRunes uses several locomotion systems (Teleport, touchpad(Vive)/stick (Oculus) locomotion) as well as  a new system named &quot;4th Wall&quot; which combines 1st person immersive gameplay with a 3rd person locomotion system in order to adress the problem of physical discomfort that affects VR players as well as to provide a new narrative to the story. 4th Wall allows close interactions (such as fighting, dealing with puzzles, etc)to happen in 1st person whereas locomotion, or roaming around the world, can be put into a 3rd person perspective with the press of a button. Players will have the freedom to choose two locomotion systems throughout different levels, using the advantages of two different systems in the progression of the game.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFEATURES:<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n  -100% designed for room scale VR.  <br />\r\n  - Cast spells by drawing in the air with motion controllers.  <br />\r\n  - Full story driven VR title with different environments and puzzle solving.<br />\r\n  - Photogrammetry for full deep and immersive worlds.  <br />\r\n  - New seamless locomotion system.  <br />\r\n  - Nodding system: answer to yes or no questions just by moving your head.",
