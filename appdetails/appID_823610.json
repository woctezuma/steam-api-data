However, upon arriving at the house, the woman disappeared. Before entering, you find that it is in fact a cave. Then you\u2019re informed by a note that the woman needs you to enter the cave and find the dragon knight, Sowen, who has a magical weapon that he intends on using to open the gates of Hell. So you descent into the dungeon and begin your search for dragon knight and a powerful weapon he possesses, hoping to stop him before he puts an end to the world.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"></h2><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/823610/extras/Steam\u5546\u5e97\u7528\u56fe_\u9152\u9986.gif?t=1555574645\" ><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">The world is counting on you</h2>Once Upon a time ...I think you are quite familiar with this kind of legends.
