Theatre, film, literature, television, music, graphic novels, and other mediums have grown to be able to support social commentary. In America, late night talk shows are one medium that is expected to offer social commentary, even though they started as being a sponsored commercial for New York theatre. If the gaming industry is interested in video games maturing as a medium, it will need to understand the difference between zero value content and content that is in accordance with their content policies, particualrly when it is in a genre they are not familiar observing as a video game.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n27,400 Words For Freedom is a 27,400 word, seven hour JRPG about the reality of choosing to live your life as a bigot. As Bannondorf, travel across America and recruit an army that will bring about the change he wishes to see in the cultural fabric of his country. 27,400 Words For Freedom features voice acting, an original soundtrack, and a multi medium approach to presenting it's narrative - cutscenes, voiced monologues, prose stories, visual novel elements, minigames, and more.",
