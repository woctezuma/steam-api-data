The rats in the sewer will eat delicious food. It may also encounter like companions and favorite objects.<br>\u25b6mu Mu: All the hard work can endure in these short moments and occasional days!<br>\u25b6mu Mu: How can you know how to be a big lady like you? Even if happiness comes very short, it is the day when the candlelight in the darkness will go out sooner or later.<br>\u25b6Mu Mu: But at least warming yourself is an important memory. Even if it is just an unknown mouse, it is a scourge.<br>\u25b6Mu Mu: But there are also happy times that belong to it.<br>Bai Weiya's original eyes without gods gradually condensed and looked at me.<br>\u25b6mu Mu: Miss Bai Da. You are so beautiful, you are so beautiful, you are so high and pure. You tell me--<br>\u25b6Mu Mu: Are you happy?<br>\u25b6Weiya Bai :...<br><br>\u25a0 Ye Chengxu - the official sweetheart of the campus<br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/856060/extras/\u53f6\u627f\u65ed.png?t=1555337058\" ><br>(back lane)<br>\u25b6mu Mu: What are you laughing at?<br>\u25b6Weiya Bai : Why don't you turn around and see?<br>I picked my eyebrows. Turned around without much thought. When you look at the moments in front of your eyes, everything solidifies. Including the original calm smile.<br>Chengxu Ye stood there. I don't know when it started, just like this, looking at me with no expression.<br>......<br>\u25b6 Chengxu Ye : I know that I am a very boring man. Monotonous is tedious, and I know work all day long. This kind of me, even if gentle, will make people tired sooner or later.<br>\u25b6 Chengxu Ye : But I just want to protect this home.<br>\u25b6 Chengxu Ye : I want to work hard to make money and make my family better. Let your family not be so tired, and so hard.<br>\u25b6 Chengxu Ye : When I become stronger, people behind me can get up. In this way, I am tired and bitter, I don't care.<br>\u25b6 Chengxu Ye : But I didn't think I was just a tool for you to win.<br>Ye Chengxu laughed at himself.<br>\u25b6 Chengxu Ye : I finally understand why I am sure that I will marry you. You always let me go to work.<br>\u25b6 Chengxu Ye : When I want to try to like you, weigh you and work. You feel that all this is a burden. You just want to retaliate and attack others.<br>\u25b6 Chengxu Ye : So... what am I?<br>Ye Chengxu looked straight into my eyes, but I didn't dare to look at him.<br>\u25b6 Chengxu Ye : I am really, I want to be with you forever - always together.<br>\u25b6 Chengxu Ye : But, you made it a once. It became a joke.<br>Said Ye Chengxu striding forward. He took off his shirt and covered it on my head. The soft touch of the clothes falling down is the gentleness that I dare not recall, and the heavyness of my mood.<br>Breathing, but also stopped.<br>\u25b6 Chengxu Ye : Anyway, you will not be rare for the rest of my life. So don't go over it.<br><br>\u25a0White Ziqi - this is the final BOSS, Bai Weiya's brother<br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/856060/extras/\u767d\u5b50\u5947.png ?t=1555337058\" ><br>(In the woods)<br>\u25b6 ziqi Bai: No one will ask for a good return for no reason, so your purpose is not to let me like you to be caught by you as a child.<br>\u25b6 ziqi Bai: I tell you, the Shaolin wants to eat swan meat. Don't do that dream without the wings.<br>\u25b6mu Mu: Mr. Bai Ziqi with wings. You compare yourself to a farm animal, why are you dragging me?<br>(on the top of the building)<br>\u25b6 ziqi Bai: Some people say that life is like white paper, what kind of environment will give it color.<br>\u25b6 ziqi Bai: But I think it is just a piece of grass. Because once it is stained, it can only be washed into the toilet, just like grass.<br>\u25b6 ziqi Bai: How many indifferent people there are in a cold and indifferent society, not rushing into the toilet will only pollute others. So do you say that there is more paper or more white paper?<br>\u25b6mu Mu:......I don\u2019t want to answer your question, you have the most ideas...<br><br>\u3013 Production related \u3013<br>\u203bThis game is completed by Xiaojinbao alone, and the materials are all available in commercial materials (see below):<br><br>\u25bc Game Engine<br>\u2237the_nvl_maker<br><br>\u25bc Game background <br>\u2237pixabay<br>\u2237\u3123Style Chau<br>\u2237MoonWind moonwind pw<br><br>\u25bc Game Music<br>\u2237dova-s jp<br>\u2237\u9b54\u738b\u9b42<br>\u2237\u7518\u8336\u306e\u97f3\u697d\u5de5\u623f<br>\u2237\u97f3\u697d\u306e\u5375<br>\u2237Pianos DauGe \u7ba1\u7406\u8005\u306f DauGe\uff08\u30c0\u30b0\uff09\u3067\u3059<br>\u2237&quot;\u30a8\u30c7\u30eb\u30db\u30ef\u30a4\u30c8&quot;&quot;white music hall&quot;<br><br>\u25bcgame sound effects <br>\u2237\u5c0f\u68ee\u5e73<br><br>\u25bc Game Script<br>\u2237\u5c0f\u91d1\u5b9d\u8d1d<br><br>\u25bc Game Production<br>\u2237\u5c0f\u91d1\u5b9d\u8d1d<br><br>\u25bc Procedural assistance<br>\u2237\u7d2b\u5fa1_\u5e7d\u5e7d<br>(Thank you very much, Teacher Zi!
