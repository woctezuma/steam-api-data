  "detailed_description": "Presented by Cracking The Cryptic, YouTube's most popular Sudoku channel, here is the brand new &quot;Sandwich Sudoku&quot; game that has become an internet sensation! <br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn Sandwich Sudoku, the puzzle is presented with extra numbers outside the grid next to each row and column.  These numbers indicate the SUM of cells sandwiched between the 1 and the 9 in that row/column.  The logic required to solve the puzzles will appeal to anyone who enjoys normal sudoku and a bit of basic maths.  Each puzzle here has been lovingly hand-crafted by Mark Goodliffe and Simon Anthony, the hosts of Cracking The Cryptic.  They've even included their own hints on each puzzle to help if you get stuck.  Mark and Simon have both represented the UK many times in the World Sudoku Championship.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;I love it!&quot; says Alex Bellos, author of Alex's Adventures in Numberland.",
