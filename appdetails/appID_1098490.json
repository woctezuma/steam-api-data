I feel like the real place has a very culturally unique significance, I personally had a great time exploring it a few years ago. I've designed this environment to be experienced from a first person perspective, with the aim of allowing the player to be immersed in the same kind of atmosphere as the real place.<br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1098490/extras/comparison.jpg?t=1561175313\" ><br>(Engine / Photo Comparison)<br><br>The map is very extensive to explore with shrine gates laid out over the entire mountainside. I've tried to include a lot of variance in different parts of the mountain, with lots of points of interest to discover and many branching/intertwining paths to encourage you to make choices with your exploration. Take photos with the in-game camera, customize the soundtrack, walk around at your own pace. There is a checklist of locations to find as well as some hidden areas, and also a small ending.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Explore the Shrine in VR! (DLC)</h2>If you own a VR headset, you can immerse yourself even more in the world with the VR compatible version I've built. I was happily surprised with how well the scene runs in virtual reality, the quality is almost on par with the desktop version and it still runs great. Everything from the desktop version is here, with some advanced DSLR camera controls, locomotion/teleportation movement options, and optimized UI/game menus.<br><br>I feel thankful that higher fidelity 3d environments have become more achievable by everyone, and not only AAA game developers. I had a blast creating this project and feel like it's really improved my skills with unreal engine. hope you enjoy exploring<br>- Matt",
