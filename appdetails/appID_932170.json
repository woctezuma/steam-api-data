Disabling sweating will change the phrases, rather than eliminate any content (similar to music industry dubs over explicit content).\r\n\r\nPlease note that some character endings may depict violent occurrences that are not for the faint of heart, such as limb removal by crowd (don't worry, no spoilers, this is just an example and not an actual character ending).\r\n\r\nUser discretion is advised."
