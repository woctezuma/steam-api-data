  "detailed_description": "Today, the Pantheon is a standard stop on any visit to Rome. The best-preserved building surviving from ancient Rome, it is a rotunda topped with an enormous dome. Now, wherever you live, you can use this app to take a virtual fieldtrip to the Pantheon with Steven Zucker and Beth Harris of Smarthistory as your guides. While you freely explore the exterior forecourt and interior sanctuary of the reconstructed complex, they will explain what you are seeing and its significance. You can toggle between the site today and the way it looked in antiquity. Go up into the air and see the Pantheon\u2019s context in the ancient city. Find out who built the Pantheon seen in Rome today and who built an earlier, vanished version of the temple on the same site. Learn about the design and decoration of the building, the nature of the religious cult housed in it, and how it was the scene of a recurrent solar spectacle each year on Rome\u2019s birthday. See what happened when it rained, and water came inside the rotunda through the great circular skylight (\u201coculus\u201d) at the top of the dome. When you are finished, go to the Rome Reborn website and take an assessment to see how your knowledge about the Pantheon stacks up against that of experts and other members of the Rome Reborn community.",

  "reviews": "\u201cI am a professor of Archaeology at the University of Florence specialised in Topography of Ancient Rome. I have followed the development of Rome Reborn VR since its inception in the 1990s. Now that the first VR applications of the project are starting to appear in online stores, I am delighted to express my strong support for this unique initiative which combines archaeological accuracy with state-of-the-art technology. The goal is to make the core monuments of the Eternal City easily comprehensible even to non-experts, and to bring ancient Rome into the homes and schools of people wherever they may be. In my opinion, the Rome Reborn VR team has brilliantly achieved this goal. --Prof. Paolo Liverani\u201d<br>5/5 \u2013 <a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=https://www.facebook.com/pg/romerebornvr/reviews/?ref=page_internal\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >Dipartimento di Storia, Archeologia, Geografia, Arte e Spettacolo, University of Florence (Italy)</a><br><br>\u201cAs Director of the Civic Museum of Rieti, about 80 km north of Rome, on Saturday, May 26, 2018 I organized, at the museum, two public demonstrations of the Rome Reborn VR application presenting the Roman Forum. Over 100 people of all ages attended both demonstrations. I can report that the response was enthusiastically positive. The event showed that Rome Reborn VR has the potential to make the study of history come alive for students and the general public. Rome Reborn VR is a great tool for the museum world and for anyone around the world who wants to learn more about ancient Rome by going back in time to visit the city as it appeared at the peak of its development in AD 320. --Dr. Monica De Simone\u201d<br>5/5 \u2013 <a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=https://www.facebook.com/pg/romerebornvr/reviews/?ref=page_internal\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >Civic Museum of Rieti (Italy)</a><br><br>\u201cThis is an *amazing* pedagogical tool with lots of applications in secondary and higher education. As a professor of Classics, I consider Roman Reborn VR an indispensable tool for courses on Roman civilization, Roman history, Roman archaeology, even Latin literature. While this app has a lot to offer to faculty and students, it will also appeal to non-academics who are interested in ancient Rome. --Prof. Zoe Stamatopoulou\u201d<br>5/5 \u2013 <a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=https://www.facebook.com/pg/romerebornvr/reviews/?ref=page_internal\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >Department of Classics, Washington University (USA)</a><br>",
