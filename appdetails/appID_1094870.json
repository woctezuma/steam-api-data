It\u2019s up to you and your friends to protect them or steal them - depending if you take on the role of an extraordinarily protective tree or as one of several crafty yet thieving squirrels - in the new cross-platform party game, \u201cAcron: Attack of the Squirrels!\u201d, from Resolution Games.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nA game that\u2019s at its best when played as a couch party game together with a group of friends, \u201cAcron: Attack of the Squirrels!\u201d is both competitive and cooperative in nature for players across VR and mobile devices.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn this hilariously fun experience one player dons a VR headset - supported at launch by Oculus Rift and HTC Vive - and takes on the character of a large, ancient tree. The tree is the sole protector of the seeds of life who must use the hand controllers to grab and hurl wood chunks, boulders and sticky sap to keep the squirrels at bay. Meanwhile, two to seven frenemies are invited to join in the fun on iOS and Android devices to take on one of four identities from a gang of rebellious squirrels that will do anything to steal the Golden Acorns and take them safely back to their home base using their unique special abilities. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nTo steal the Golden Acorns, the squirrels have several tools at their disposal including the ability to pick up and plant seeds that grow into pumpkin barriers, plant bushes to hide behind, place mushrooms they can use as leaping pads and more. All the while, the tree tries to knock out the squirrels that are out to steal the acorns by using the hand controllers from their VR headset to grab and hurl wood chunks, boulders and sticky sap to keep the squirrels at bay until an ultimate victor is deemed at the end of the match.",
