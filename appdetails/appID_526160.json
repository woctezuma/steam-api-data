Moving freely while charging your Power Attack allows for a more tactical approach to hunting. You can now <strong>throw any equipped weapon</strong> - which is really useful for dealing damage to your opponents from a distance. Dads  the ability to <strong>lock onto enemies</strong> during combat, which improves your general aim. <br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/526160/extras/newbattle_tip_mainpage.jpg?t=1520767681\" > <br><br>We\u2019ve also added a few improvements to the way you use throws - for example, RMB no longer acts as a dedicated throwing button. You still can throw items out of your inventory with the T button, so you\u2019ll be able to share resources (or hit your friend in the face with some human meat) any time you want. <br><br>Along with an updated Battle System, 0.8 features minor quality-of-life improvements and general bug fixes. <br><br>We hope you enjoy checking out the new update, while we continue working on The Wild Eight and enhancing the player experience. Check back for more details real soon!</p><br><h1>About the Game</h1>The Wild Eight is in a constant state of improvement, and it is not yet complete. If you are not ready for rare bugs and wipes, we recommend waiting for the full release. This does not mean that the game is unplayable or lacks features, it\u2019s actually vice-versa! Right now The Wild Eight is fully enjoyable and has all main features such as the multiplayer, storyline and side quests. Buying the game and providing your feedback during Early Access will support us in improving the game.

Survive and live to tell the tale of The Wild Eight.<br><br>In The Wild Eight always keeping on the move is your only way to survive and find out what happened with this mysterious place.
