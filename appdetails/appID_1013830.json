Stories also portray a more realistic romance, as opposed to the mostly idealized romance in shoujo manga/games.\r\n\r\nSince the genre of our games is Josei, the content of our games may be offensive and emotionally unsafe for some readers. The following trigger list illustrates the content that can be found in our games. \r\n\r\n-Rape and Sexual Assault \r\n-Abuse \r\n(physical, mental, emotional, verbal, sexual)\r\n-Child Abuse \r\n- Self-injurious behavior and Suicide\r\n- Excessive and Gratuitous Violence\r\n- Needles \r\n- Blood, death and dying \r\n- Kidnapping \r\n- Mental Illness \r\n- Breach of human rights \r\n- Depiction of love making scenes\r\n"
