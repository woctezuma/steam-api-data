False priorities can act like blinders and make us overlook the ever-present beauty of the universe, which can be our greatest source of energy and inspiration. A positive and grateful mindset enables us to harvest that energy to fuel our inner space and retain well-being. With this virtual-reality experience I express my own appreciation for and feelings about the gift of life.
