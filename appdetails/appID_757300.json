Yes, that's your name in this scenario. While you're at it, think of Tr\u00fcberbrook, a remote village in rural, mountain-sloped and densely forested cold-war Germany. Because, that's where you somehow end up after hitting the continent. But who cares, you won the trip in a lottery! Or at least, that\u2019s how it seems.

Truber-what? No idea!

But who would do that? And why?<br><br>Gradually, he gets to know the various villagers and spa guests, one more peculiar than the other. Only young anthropologist Greta Lemke, who is on a research trip to Tr\u00fcberbrook, seems normal to him.
