Set in a regular suburban home, the story is told over alternating time periods spanning 13 years.<br>Through environmental storytelling, Infliction tackles taboo subject matter. While you're discovering what has happened over the last 13 years, you're being stalked by an evil entity. Can you learn enough to vanquish the evil that lies within this family home or will you become a victim?<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Features</h2><strong>Multilayered story</strong><br>The story is not forced down your throat. You will decide how much you\u2019d like to learn via exploration. The story is told through memories, exposition, and environmental storytelling. Memories are delivered via audio after discovering something with a memory tied to it. Exposition is delivered via the radio, phone and television. The environment will also tell the story so the more you explore, the richer the story. Not everything is explicitly told to you but there are clues everywhere.<br><br><strong>Deeply interactive environment</strong><br>You can pick up and examine anything that\u2019s not bolted down.

The environment will reflect what was going on in that period.<br><br><strong>Dynamic AI</strong><br>The AI\u2019s behaviour will change depending on where you are in the story.
