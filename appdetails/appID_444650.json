Find out more at our <a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://endciv.de/roadmap\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >Roadmap</a></a>.<br>The circles above are indicators of how complete the game is in these categories.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Building</h2>Construction and city building aspects. The number and variation of buildings and objects will be constantly increased during development and it will become more challenging for you to build more advanced buildings.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Economy</h2>The economy of the game is our highest priority at the moment. This includes the number of different goods and production facilities but also how trading and resource management performs. We constantly improve and adjust balancing.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Combat</h2>Combat features are a low priority and will be implemented once the economy and building features are more solidly implemented.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Immersion</h2>The last aspect describes the emotional and ethical aspects of the game. We want to provide a grungy post-civilization scenario and believable events in the game. This also describes how detailed the game will be. The full potential of this aspect can only be achieved towards the end of development.</p><br><h1>About the Game</h1><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>You\u2019ve managed cities in medieval ages, Rome, Egypt, foreign planets \u2013 Now it's time to discover the wastelands!</strong></h2><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">OVERVIEW</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Rebuild civilization in a world full of misery and cruelty<br></li><li>Craft a flourishing town from the ashes of the past<br></li><li>Decide yourself either to conquer or to ally<br></li><li>Enjoy a detailed simulated world</li></ul><br>In a world where civilization suffered from weather phenomena and collapsed financial markets, a group of people lost their shelter and are now on the search for a new place to live. Help these people to survive in the wastelands. Explore the unknown environment to find shelter and a supply of food and water for the early days. Your foremost duty is to avoid dehydration and starvation at all cost. <br><br>Enjoy a detailed simulation. Manage food and water under harsh conditions. Water loses quality over time and food does rot. Even rotten food does not just disappear but has to be composted. During the game you also have to manage energy, agriculture and labor and each aspect relies on certain real world aspects. <br><br>Lead a successful settlement. Acquire a fortune of goods, keep your citizens satisfied and improve the daily routine with new technology and resources. Then your reputation will increase and strangers will take notice. You will be visited by nomads who want to join your tribe and merchants who want to offer a trade. <br><br>But beware, big attention will also lead to threats. How you will deal with it is up to you! Either arm up or focus on strong allies - both are viable strategies.<br><br>Please do keep in mind that the game is still in development.<br>Visit our <a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://endciv.de/roadmap\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >Roadmap</a></a> and <a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://community.endciv.de/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >Forum</a></a> for more information.",
