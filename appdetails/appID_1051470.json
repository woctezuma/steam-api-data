  "detailed_description": "<h1>More Information</h1><p>This is my very first PC release and I've worked extremely hard to add controller compatibility. It's 90% there and due to time/money constraints I had to determine this to be &quot;good enough&quot;. The character and level select screens are the only places where controller does not work 100% and will be reworked after the initial release to make the game fully compatible with the controllers.</p><br><h1>About the Game</h1>Super Panda has returned for an all new and incredible 2.5D side scrolling adventure. This time he brought friends. Join Super Panda and Friends on a wild and fun journey through forest, underwater caverns, desert, caves, lava and more! \r\n\r\nIncredible adventure with 8 playable characters. Each with their own attacks, abilities and secrets. \r\nSuper easy controls. Left, right, jump and attack. \r\nInteresting pet mechanism. Buy and upgrade pets to gain special bonuses and attacks through your journey.\r\n40 challenging levels through 9 worlds to explore. \r\nWide variety of monsters to fight! Square off against Forest Golems, pixies, Crazed Mushrooms, hornets, Mantis, giant lady bugs and many more!\r\n8 Boss battles of legendary proportion!\r\nEpic adventure awaits! \r\n\r\nMore information about the game. \r\nYou have 8 Playable characters to choose from, each with their own special attack. \r\nPanda tosses an acorn that pops and will get really close monsters. \r\nDeer throws a Love bomb that explodes into magical hearts. \r\nBear throws a giant angry weight that crushes enemies and blocks. It can open secret doors. \r\nGorilla throws giant boulders that break down iron barriers and crushes all opposition in his way. \r\nFox that clever man tosses a classic cartoon bomb that clears out small areas. Be careful it can hurt you too!\r\nLenny the Lemur, always crafty has a spiked ball that rolls on the ground and hurts the monsters feet.\r\nRabbit, our favorite little critter. Always thinking. He has a spiked spinning top than he throws and it zips across the ground wreaking comical havoc among the forest dwellers. \r\nLast but not least, out favorite of all, Bad Panda! His attack is special to say the least, he throws a fart bomb. I little f-bomb that hilariously explodes into poo farting it's way through the monsters and making you laugh so hard that hopefully you are not on a busy train playing. \r\n\r\nPets\r\nThere's currently 8 pets. Each has a unique personality and comical sayings. They're a fun addition to the panda world.\r\nThey all have special little abilities to help and can be used to search for free spins on Lemur's Lucky Spin. \r\nThe Imp burns all in your path for that special time of need. \r\nBunkins and his magnetic personality helps collect coins and other hard to reach items. \r\nMoony keeps you alive by offering up some health in times of need. \r\nPumpky all plump with gold increases the level ending rewards for extra riches. \r\nRockster is a treasure hunter and increases the chances of a successful treasure hunt.\r\nShroomy helps see value in things and grants level end rewards. \r\nTeddy is a huge bonus to have with you at the end of each level.
