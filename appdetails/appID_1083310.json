  "detailed_description": "<h1>A Word From The Dev</h1><p><strong>OUTBUDDIES</strong>' development started as a spare time passion-project in early 2013, influenced by timeless classics of my childhood starring Super Metroid, Castlevania, Super Mario Bros., and Mega Man. The quality, depth, and acceptance of indie metroidvanias like Axiom Verge &amp; Hollow Knight proved what can be achieved by small teams or even single persons. Those developers inspired me to allocate even more personal resources and dedication to the project so it could eventually evolve into something really special.<br><br>As a father, daytime employee, and gamer myself I loved how progression and iteration were tackled in outstanding indie platformer Celeste, so <strong>OUTBUDDIES</strong> was designed to provide challenging and encouraging gameplay while skipping punishing throwbacks and grinding mechanics in total. I listen to feedback and I'm dedicated to support and improve the game further after release, so shoot me your feedback anytime!<br><br><strong>Julian Laufer, Game Designer &amp; Developer</strong></p><br><h1>About the Game</h1><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1083310/extras/steam_boss_razoth.gif?t=1563805842\" ><br><br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1083310/extras/outbuddies_steam_description.png?t=1563805842\" ><br>Enter Bahlam, a sunken city of the Old Gods, located deep in the South Atlantic Ocean. Following a shipwreck, adventurer and maritime archaeologist Nikolay Bernstein regains consciousness 36.000 feet under the sea. He's severely wounded and unwillingly connected to a supernatural Buddy-unit. Searching for answers about his displacement our main protagonist digs deep into the lost undercity, gradually realizing an ominous presence hollowing in its shadowed caverns.<br><br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1083310/extras/outbuddies_steam_meet_the_wozan.png?t=1563805842\" ><br>On your journey home you will share your fate with a friendly tribe of mining creatures, the Wozan, who fear the Old Gods and strive to get back to the surface since their ancestors had been enslaved 5000 years ago. Some of them were able to flee and founded secret colonies deep inside the sunken ruins, others are still exploited by the hostile creatures that have overtaken the city since the Old Gods suddenly disappeared.<br><br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1083310/extras/steam_tortune_enemy.gif?t=1563805842\" ><br><br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1083310/extras/outbuddies_steam_open_world.png?t=1563805842\" ><br>Experience real non-linear Metroidvania gameplay and uncover five distinct areas, all with remarkable puzzles, environmental hazards, epic boss encounters and captured Wozan to uncage. Your Buddy unit will procedurally map the area and function as a handy quality of life tool that can be controlled at will to manipulate your surroundings using various abilities like hacking, scanning, and telekinesis.<br><br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1083310/extras/outbuddies_steam_mech_skill.png?t=1563805842\" ><br>Explore Bahlam with high freedom of movement like climbing, crawling and diving right from the start.

All pixel art will scale crisp and free of distortion artifacts to your native screen resolution. The game runs at 60 FPS. A hybrid physics engine ensures realistic accelerations and object movements while maintaining the pixel perfect control of the old classics.
