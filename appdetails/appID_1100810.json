This would primarily be demonstrated when players use their fists, melee weapons, ranged weapons, or tamed creatures against other players and/or other creatures. Violence may also be demonstrated when wild npc creatures choose to attack player characters and/or other wild or tamed creatures within the game world. Depictions of and reactions to violence (by targeted player character or creature) are not realistically portrayed and the level of blood associated with these acts is mild and limited. "
