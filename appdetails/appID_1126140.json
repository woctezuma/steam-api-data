You usually start off with a basic gun, such as a pistol and as the waves get harder, you collect more powerful guns such as alien shotguns. Enemies drop health packs, ammo and guns. There is both friendly AI, the soldiers, snipers and others and enemy AI. Your job is to protect your soldiers and to help them defend the base. Some of the environment, such as sandbags and cacti, are destructible and serve as obstacles. Barrels and other heavy objects can be pushed into strategic locations to hinder the enemy's movement. You need to employ a vast variety of tactics if you wish to survive the massacre.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe game has been inspired by the Facebook event Storm Area 51.",
