It\u2019s going to be different, because it\u2019s about real people, about events that are touching and horrifying even now. Let\u2019s go back in time. It all began with a meeting between a boy and a girl who came from two different worlds. For a short time they had good laughs together, taking joy simply from each other\u2019s company. Unfortunately, all good things must come to an end. War broke out \u2013 the Evil King plundered the city and his robot-soldiers appeared everywhere. Citizens were separated and some of them were marked and forced to move out of their homes and live in a place that was sealed off from the rest of the city by a huge wall. Fortunately the children were not alone \u2013 they had each other. Their friendship allowed them to stay together, even though fate seemed to try to tear them apart. That\u2019s the story behind My Memory of Us, a game dedicated to those that were separated, but managed to find the strength to meet each other again.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWhat makes My Memory of Us stand out is that the story is told from the perspective of two friends who complete each other.

You just want to have fun with your friend. Go on then! Grab her hand and find out what adventures are waiting for you outside.
