Well, that was the idea, at least. After years of success, Camp Campbell is now understaffed and underfunded, and Campbell isn\u2019t seeing the profits he\u2019s used to. Fortunately, he had the best idea ever: Turn Camp Campbell into a Math Camp, Space Camp, Adventure Camp, Fat Camp, EVERY CAMP! Now, parents from all over the country have sent their children to Camp Campbell with high expectations\u2026 and the poor camp counselors must do their best to cover every kind of camp curriculum known to man. Whether you\u2019re a camper or a counselor, you\u2019re bound to enjoy Camp Campbell\u2026 because that\u2019s a contractual obligation advertised in the brochure. Camp Camp tells the story of Max, a jaded ten-year-old, who finds himself stuck at this dysfunctional summer camp. The cynical Max will have to survive annoyingly cheerful counselor David, the weird cast of campers, and bizarre surprises at every turn before he can escape for home.",
