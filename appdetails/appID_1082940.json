In every level, you can shoot a predefined number of gumballs before the entire level drops one line down making things a bit harder to finish.<br><br><strong>Time Attack</strong><br>This game is the total opposite to the Puzzle by Puzzle game and it's all about time here. Put your mind and reflexes to the test by trying to clear all gumballs before the required level time runs out.
