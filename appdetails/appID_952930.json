Those of us who made it are now living in ruined cities behind steel gates that separate the cities from one another and from deadly creatures roaming the wastelands.

Your goal? To guard the city walls against constant attacks of horrifying human-machine hybrids. Be sure they\u2019ll use all their skills, weapons and won\u2019t hesitate to sacrifice their life when needed, as unlike any living being, they\u2019re not driven by a self-preservation instinct but pure will to kill.<br><br><img src=\"https://%CDN_HOST_MEDIA_SSL%/steam/apps/952930/extras/steam_07_robot.png?t=1554221929\" crossorigin=\"anonymous\"><br><br>You however have what your opponents don\u2019t.

Good! Be sure your robotic arms are capable of way more than just pulling the trigger. Use them, to get cover from bombs. Equip your mech with a harpoon to eliminate enemies from the distance. Drag them, crush them, watch them bleed and throw away what\u2019s left of them. Then enjoy observing what impact your little horrifying show had on remaining enemies, that will literally freeze in fear. And once the situation on a battle field gets really serious, wait for the hostile horde to come anyway near an explosive, then blow it and enjoy the mayhem.<br><br>And you better be ready to make a good use of your mech\u2019s weapons and defensive skills at all times, as each opponent you\u2019ll be facing, starting from heavily-armored Guards having a shield and hammer at his disposal, to flying, bomb-throwing Jumpers, has their own set of skills and combat strategies, challenging your wits and testing your tactical talents.<br><br>You can play the game standing, or sitting comfortably in a chair, but you must not forget to be constantly looking in different directions and using both hands and weapons at the same time, as death can come from literally anywhere. So keeping your eyes around your head will be crucial for your victory in combat. The same applies when properly deciding on which targets to destroy first during the battle.
