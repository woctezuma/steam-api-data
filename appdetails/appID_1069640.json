Explore the vast 100 mi<sup>2</sup> world full of hostile humans and animals while defining your narrative through the decisions you make. Survive, hunt, craft, unite and lead the tribes to take back your lands.<br><br><strong>The World Setting</strong><br><br>You begin your journey as a chief of a small Native American tribe set to take back the lands of your people. The settlers are expanding rapidly and crashing all resistance. What remains of the Native American are dwelling in reservations while only a few are still resisting the enemy. You are to lead your people against all the odds, survive the expansion of the settlers, unite the tribes and retaliate. <br><br><strong>Warriors</strong><br><br>As a chief, you have warriors who are inspired by your leadership, and they are the backbone of your survival. You can send them out to gather essential resources, settle on new camps, and even attack the enemy with you. <br><br><strong>Settling and Expansion</strong><br><br>You will choose your approaches to take down the enemy camps, mines, settlements, and forts. Once the area is clear of hostile, you can send your brave warriors to settle in new camps and expand accordingly. Each step will take you closer to securing back your lands. <br><br><strong>Combat</strong><br><br>This Land Is My Land is primarily a stealth game, however, you are the chief and you decide how you want to fight the enemy. You will utilize various weapons such as knives, bows, pistols, and rifles in addition to traps and intimidation. <br><br><strong>Dynamic Game Changes</strong><br><br>The environment of the game changes dynamically depending on your decisions. Each action you make will have an impact on the world. Geography remains the same but patrols, enemy camps, and even the rate of new warriors joining your cause will be different. As a result, each walkthrough you will face unique challenges and outcomes. <br><br><strong>Karma</strong><br><br>Your actions determine your karma. Both positive and negative karma has its own benefits and disadvantages. Depending on your playstyle, you can choose your path.<br><br><strong>Skills and Progress</strong><br><br>Taking back your land is a long, challenging process. Take the time to upgrade your skills which will unlock more crafting, combat, and other options that will aid your progress. <br><br><strong>Crafting and Gathering</strong><br><br>You and your warriors need to gather resources to survive, craft weapons, and tools to fight the enemy. Various resources will also help you upgrade and expand your camps, which will allow you to house more warriors. <br><br><strong>Hunting and Taming</strong><br><br>Horses are essential for combat and transportation. You can tame wild horses and hunt animals such as wolves, boars, and bears for resources. <br><br><strong>Bartering and Trading</strong><br><br>Not everyone is your enemy; there are still some who are open to trade and barter with you for the right price.",
