Fly, explore, play, create, and immerse yourself in massive surreal worlds of breathtaking visuals - a bioluminescent forest coming to life at sunset, a crystalline mountaintop bathed in the aurora borealis, the center of the universe deep inside a shifting nebula. In each world, you'll discover incredible art - enormous sculptures, alien plant life, gorgeous landscapes, dazzling lights/lasers, as well as many other secrets that cannot even be described.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFunctioning as a social metaverse and 24/7 VR music festival, meet up with friends and other music lovers face-to-face in audio-reactive worlds that the music brings to life. Choose between listening to sets from top artists like Big Gigantic and STS9, user-created mixes and synchronized playlists, or ANY music you can imagine in this mind-melting audio-visual feast for the senses.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nCustomize your avatar to reflect your digital persona while you chat, dance, and play \u201cface-to-face\u201d in public venues or private listening parties. Exploring the vast panorama and digital landscape of Soundscape VR reveals a virtual world unlike any other, full of imaginative art, impossible settings, and limitless ways to play. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nWe've partnered with festival favorite artists, some of the most talented acts on the planet, to deliver you and your friends music in the ultimate way.
