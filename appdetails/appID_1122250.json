He will have to ask for money from passers-by, sometimes steal money in order to survive in these harsh conditions. From the first minutes of the game you will immediately be given a unique task. You have to quickly perform tasks, move to locations and talk to the NPC, and at the same time monitor your hunger indicator and health. You will have to regularly visit grocery stores. So you always need to take care that in your pocket was enough money for food. By completing missions, you earn reputation and money.
