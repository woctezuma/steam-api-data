  "reviews": "\u201c...the soundtrack matches the artstyle perfectly. Whether it be a playful piano ditty while you pilot a mech suit that shoots cats or an emotional strings piece while you\u2019re exploring a brand-new area, there\u2019s a childlike sense of optimistic wonderment that\u2019s being reinforced throughout the game. The soundtrack does a great job of setting up the right atmosphere when it needs to, further immersing you in this strange, fantasy world.\u201d<br>9/10 \u2013 <a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/aegis_defenders\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >Nintendo Life</a><br><br>\u201cThe music is very nice, and oozes quality. Just listening to the orchestrated soundtrack makes you think of nature with hints of Secret of Mana.\u201d<br>9.1/10 \u2013 <a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=https://gbatemp.net/review/aegis-defenders.718/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >GBAtemp</a><br><br>\u201cThe soundtrack can be as incredible as the graphics, as well as the songs that fit perfectly with the environment, they have an inexplicable nostalgic factor. Some tracks reminded me a lot of the songs of Mega Man Legends, the 3D Adventure of Mega Man released for the first PlayStation, which is great, since the franchise has always been and always will be reference in quality soundtracks.\u201d<br>10 \u2013 <a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://www.gamerview.com.br/aegis-defenders/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >Gamerview</a><br>",
