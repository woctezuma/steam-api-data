It combines a high performance dual rotor system with a deadly weapons payload of guided missiles, rockets, bombs, and a 30mm cannon. The Ka-50 is also unique in that it has an ejection seat.

We haven\u2019t seen a product this complex in more than a decade. Just when you thought that the hardcore simulation market was dead, along comes DCS Black Shark. If you were a fan of the legendary AH-64D Longbow and Longbow 2 from Jane\u2019s Combat Simulations, you\u2019ll find this is another instant helicopter classic that shouldn\u2019t be overlooked. It\u2019s very challenging but also very rewarding.&quot;\u201d<br>89% \u2013 <a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://www.armchairgeneral.com/dcs-black-shark-pc-game-review.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >Armchair General</a></a><br><br>\u201c&quot;Black Shark harkens back to a not so long line of spectacular air combat simulations. There are plenty of air combat games and simulations out there, but the list of them that are truly spectacular is short, Black Shark can I feel be proudly counted as one of them. While it may not raise the bar per say, Black Shark is a solid air combat simulation game that many simulation aficionados have been waiting for.&quot;\u201d<br>90% \u2013 <a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://www.impulsegamer.com/pcdscblackshark.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >Impulse Gamer</a></a><br>",
