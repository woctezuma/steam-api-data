Movement is non-linear, with an initial flick-dodge, step jumping (aka double jumping) and speed building via 'glitching'\u2122. Air control is medium-high and autojumping is a thing. Weapons are the &quot;holy trinity&quot; plus a pulse or shotgun starting weapon, and the ability to combo a rocket with rail. Maps are iconic archetypes of the genre. Hitsounds and hitmarkers on the way. Learn the game with HUD item timers.<br><br>Glitch is designed by competitive gamers for constant good games between players of similar experience. So if you've got a friend or two you love to shoot, it's for you. You don't need a thousand concurrent players for a good time.",
