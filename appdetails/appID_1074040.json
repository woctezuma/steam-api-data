  "detailed_description": "The Red Prison is a roguelike based on the OGL-content of the SRD for 5th edition Dungeons &amp; Dragons. The Basic Rules is (largely) a stripped back version of those rules and this game takes a similar approach. The game mostly follows those rules faithfully and they are included with the download. Development is still in its early stages and at this stage any available builds are playable but unstable.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe game features four classes (fighter, rogue, wizard and cleric) and four base races with subraces (human, mountain dwarf, hill dwarf, wood elf, high elf, lightfoot halfling and stoutheart halfling). You can fully customise all aspects of your character and recruit magic users, fighters, thugs and priests as henchmen to support you as you explore the depths of the Red Prison. There is an infinite procedurally generated dungeon filled with hordes of monsters to encounter in this traditional roguelike.",
