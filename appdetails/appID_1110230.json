The later DLC will be launched one after another, so stay tuned<br><br>Background Story:<br>In the early 1980s, in order to develop rapidly in science and technology, the government launched an experimental project codenamed &quot;Xiangshan No. 31&quot;, established No. 31 weather station across the country, and the underground station was hollowed out to build a particle collider. The method of particle collision finds new substances and tries to fundamentally change the backwardness of science and technology. These experimental sites were uniformly disguised as meteorological stations, and the sites were located in the deep mountains far from the city, and experiments were carried out within a few hundred meters of the interior of the mountain or even underground. Due to the high risk and uncertainty of the experiment, after 10 years, that is, in the 1990s, there were cases of experimental failures, and some incidents that were beyond the control of researchers at the time and now, according to retired staff, began. It was only the failure of the collision test. Later, each collision experiment produced high-radiation substances that scientists could not explain, which caused the project team to cause radiation damage even in the case of wearing protective clothing, thus unable to control the instrument. The most serious one, the collider could not be cooled, and a huge explosion occurred. The government claimed that it was a small earthquake, which obscured the vibration caused by the experiment. After the millennium, the state ordered the suspension of all relevant experiments, and destroyed all experimental materials and experimental results, all relevant personnel retired or resigned early, and signed a very strict confidentiality agreement.<br><br>Xiao Li\u2019s grandfather was a retired weather station worker. Time flies. After his grandfather\u2019s death, he left a map with a weather station visible on the map, and a date clearly written on it. Curious Xiao Li was always uneasy, and finally decided to come to the weather station on the appointed date to find out.<br><br>Xiao Li took the map left by his grandfather and sneaked into the place marked on the map in the middle of the night.<br>This is a weather radar station, but there are a lot of awkward places, such as radar stations that seem to have been abandoned, there are security guards, and there are people who are repairing solar panels. However, if all this happens during the day, it will be late at night. With a strong curiosity, Xiao Li decided to sneak into the weather station to see what happened.<br>When Xiao Li sneaked into the weather station, he was shocked by everything in front of him. He didn't even know how long he had not been dynamic. Zhengda couldn't speak. It was a weather station staff. The whole body was covered with stones. It was on the desk. It was exactly like being petrified. The staff\u2019s behavior was not exaggerated. It can be judged that the entire petrochemical process was completed in an instant, as if I was glanced at by the mythical Medusa, and everything was too late to react. People have become big stones. The entire room floor has been partially lifted by a substance similar to magma, causing it to rupture and emitting a lot of heat. Xiao Li has no time to feel how hot he is. When he is about to turn around and rush out of the room, another strange phenomenon Let him hesitate. The room is in the middle and there is an elevator that looks like it is underground. This means there must be a space in the ground. Xiao Li set his mind, curiosity and grandfather's strange words and behaviors made him really want to see what to do.<br>Xiao Li decided to take the elevator into the mountain to see what was below. It would be a big deal to come back. However, the elevator has been damaged.
