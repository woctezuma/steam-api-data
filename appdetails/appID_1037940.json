Currently there is only an autosave system. Autosaves will be deleted upon starting a new game or player defeat and there is no &quot;manual&quot; loading and saving. Autosaves are not guaranteed to work between major updates. Certain combat mechanics may also feel unfair, broken or too &quot;hardcore&quot;. I'm only one guy and I can only test the game so much through public demos on IndieDB and internally. In order to get real feedback and exposure though, I need to involve the community as a whole and that's why I'm here now in Early Access. I've tried to be as detailed and transparent as possible, if you feel the game is not ready yet based on what I've mentioned below, it would probably be best to hold out and not buy the game yet. For those that do buy it to provide me with feedback and to help support ongoing development, you have my utmost gratitude. I won't sugarcoat things, not everything may be working as intended.</strong><br><br>Dead Monarchy is a turn-based, tactical RPG with roguelike elements, inspired by games such as Battle Brothers, XCOM and Jagged Alliance. Equip your warriors with historically inspired equipment and attempt to survive in a dying world overrun by all manner of monsters.<br><br>Currently the game consists of two layers. The &quot;town&quot; layer where you manage the player base and the &quot;combat&quot; layer where you engage enemies in turn-based tactical combat. As it stands, the core gameplay loop is to go out on a mission, gather resources, then spend those resources on upgrading buildings which in turn provide a variety of bonuses to your warriors. As you continue to upgrade your town and go out on expeditions, time will pass and the enemy will grow stronger and then will eventually attack your town. Failing a base assault without being completely wiped out will result in your building upgrades being destroyed. <br><br>This weakens the player and makes it harder for the player to achieve victory. To win the game in its current Early Access state, you must defeat all 5 Monarchs, one for each respective biome. This eventually results in a race against the enemy, with the enemy trying to wipe out your town and with the player trying to become strong enough to defeat all 5 Monarchs before getting wiped out.<br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1037940/extras/Dead_Monarchy_Features.jpg?t=1560876786\" ><br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Turn-based, tactical combat where the player can control up to 18 warriors at once.
