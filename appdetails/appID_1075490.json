It\u2019s a stunning game. The puzzles are fun and clever, too, and the orchestral music is simply wonderful.\u201d<br><a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=https://amostagreeablepastime.com/2019/04/24/theres-a-demo-available-for-the-lovely-looking-luna-the-shadow-dust/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >A Most Agreeable Pastime</a><br><br>\u201cThere are few games as engrossing as well-made point &amp;click puzzle adventures\u2014nothing catches my eye quite like the intersection of intellectual challenge and stellar artwork.\u201d<br><a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://cliqist.com/2016/04/22/lantern-studio-team-behind-luna-shadow-dust/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >Cliquist</a><br>",
