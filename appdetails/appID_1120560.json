With careful attention to pacing, atmosphere and storytelling, Sense hopes to return the horror genre to its roots; celebrating the slow, fearful creep of dread instead of relying on over the top action and jump scares. The ghosts - as glitches on our reality - act as spiritual and paranormal threats, not monsters to be killed. The horror of our story comes from atmosphere and storytelling, not loud sound and artificial effects.<br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1120560/extras/story.png?t=1563816272\" ><br><br>In 2083 Neo Hong Kong, a young woman named Mei Lin Mak is dragged into a maelstrom of supernatural horror. As she peers deeper into the century old mystery, Mei will be forced to question her perception of reality and her trust of her cybernetic eyes. Under the neon lights of a cyperpunk dystopia, the ruins of the 'Chong Sing Apartments' hides a bloody mystery illuminated by both the traditions of Chinese folklore and the innovations of the industrial future. If there is any hope of escaping this nightmare, Mei-Lin must explore this complex, piecing together the stories of 14 lost souls, and discover the truth of her own family curse. <br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1120560/extras/gp.png?t=1563816272\" ><br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1120560/extras/gameplayicons_inter.jpg?t=1563816272\" ><br><br>The player will need to search and examine every nook and cranny of the world around them in order to progress.
