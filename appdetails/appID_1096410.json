Think interactive story meets choices-that-matter; dark, atmospheric, emotional narration meets Telltale-like way of creating morally challenging dilemmas, answers to which are entirely up to the players, allowing them to reach one of a variety of possible endings.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">How does <strong>Coteries of New York</strong> play?</h2><br>You act as a newly-fledged vampire in New York. You have to learn what it means to be one of the Kindred in a huge, vibrant, contemporary metropolis. On your way you\u2019ll meet different NPCs \u2013 other vampires, thin-bloods, ghouls, humans... and more. You will perform tasks that will put test your humanity and take part in a complex and often brutal struggle for power between the Camarilla and the Anarchs. You\u2019ll build your Coterie and learn your undead companions\u2019 deepest secrets\u2026 or see them abandon you. You\u2019ll feast on the living and will ask yourself about the very nature of humanity and will feel the constant lure of the Beast inside you. You will make choices for the character, including which storylines to pursue and how to approach the different situations presented. You will take part in a narrative experience with branching dialogue choices, memorable characters - all among iconic locales of the Big Apple. You\u2019ll be able to use Disciplines to charm, sneak, intimidate or kill and your choices will determine your path.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">If it\u2019s called Vampire: The Masquerade, does that mean you have something in common with World of Darkness, Bloodlines 2, the cult tabletop RPG system, or...?</h2><br>Yes, exactly! <strong>Coteries of New York</strong> is set in a fully licensed universe of Vampire: The Masquerade 5th Edition! However, even if you know nothing about the setting, don't fret! The game is designed to meet the expectations of both Vampire: The Masquerade veterans, and new players, who never had an opportunity to delve into the World of Darkness.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">What about replayability and post-launch support?</h2><br>You\u2019ll be able to choose your character from three different vampires, representing three iconic Camarilla Clans (we\u2019ll unveil them at a later date). Every character has access to a different set of Disciplines (unique supernatural skills that are characteristic to that Clan) and different narration. Your initial choice also influences your Coterie members\u2019 approach to you, dialogue lines, possible side quests etc. Hence, it takes hours to experience every piece of content we prepared. You\u2019ll go through the main quest, side quests and loyalty quests (aimed to build closer relations between the protagonist and members of your Coterie). BUT one playthrough is definitely not enough to see every piece of content we\u2019ve prepared.<br><br>As for post-launch support, you can definitely expect new, standalone stories, enriching the lore, telling different bloody stories from the history of vampiric New York and adding new twists to interpersonal plots.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Which platforms will <strong>Coteries of New York</strong> be available on?</h2><br><strong>Coteries of New York</strong> will be available on PC (Windows, MAC OS, Linux) and Nintendo Switch. The game will launch on both platforms simultaneously. Other platforms, like PS4 and Xbox One, are not out of the question, but we're taking a &quot;wait and see&quot; approach.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">When will <strong>Coteries of New York</strong> be released?</h2><br><strong>Coteries of New York</strong> will be released in Q4 2019! We\u2019ll unveil the final date when we\u2019re closer to launch.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Which language versions will be supported?</h2><br>That's a huge and very difficult topic because of localisation costs and time constraints. We understand that Vampire: The Masquerade has fans all over the world and we would like <strong>Coteries of New York</strong> to be available in many different languages, including English, French, Italian, German, Spanish, Polish, Russian, Turkish, Chinese, Japanese and Brazilian Portuguese. We'll be able to share more information closer to launch.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Will the game support controllers?</h2><br>Yes! As <strong>Coteries of New York</strong> will launch simultaneously on PC and Switch, you\u2019ll be able to play the PC version both with mouse and keyboard, as well as with a controller. Full list of supported controllers will be revealed closer to launch.",
