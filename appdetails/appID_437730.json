Development time spans several thousands of hours during about seven relatively active development years in our spare time since we started in 2004 when we met at college - and all the way to now, in 2017. <br><br><br>The game runs on our own ol\u2019 SolidEngine based on DirectX9 that we made way back when the real engines weren\u2019t free. This has been an awesome learning experience but sadly also means constraints in what we can do without changing or massively updating the engine (release platforms, multiplayer..). Roadclub has went through many iterations over the years and the original version was finally on sale in late 2008. Since we were greenlit on Steam in 2015 we spent these past two years upgrading the game to the state it\u2019s in now. If you decide to support our crazy endeavor we'll be eternally grateful and maybe we'll be able to start a new, perhaps a bit smaller, project in the future. So thanks so much for your support, we really appreciate it!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Steam version upgrades</h2>This is the remastered Steam version of the original Roadclub released in 2008. We've improved it in tons of ways since we were greenlit in 2015. Here are the most important improvements:<br><br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Added Steam features like achievements, cloud save and leaderboards.<br></li><li>Added 2-player local splitscreen multiplayer. Race your best friend or nemesis to show them who\u2019s boss!<br></li><li>HD resolution and widescreen support (the original was hardcoded to 800x600). It now also has experimental support for ultra-wide 21:9 screens for larger individual splitscreen views!<br></li><li>Full controller support, using both DirectInput and XInput which means that the game supports older USB gamepads, sticks and wheels, not just modern Xbox controllers like most games today.<br></li><li>Remade most of the user interface. We\u2019ve redesigned every screen to make the game easier to use. We know there\u2019s even more to be done here but it\u2019s a good foundation.<br></li><li>Remade tons of art assets and increased texture and track resolutions.<br></li><li>Put AI drivers through some training and gave them some new shopping tactics between races.<br></li><li>Improved the car physics in several ways balancing speed and handling to make it the most fun to play.<br></li><li>Added new tracks and removed old ones that didn't make the cut. We now value quality and diversity over quantity. More tracks can always be added later.<br></li><li>Remade all the cars (some art assets are the same). Even more to come.<br></li><li>Rewrote huge parts of the almost 100k lines of code to be more maintainable and less prone to bugs.<br></li><li>Squashed a ton of those pesky insects (bugs) after lots of testing by a lot more people than the last release (which was mostly ourselves).</li></ul><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">The future</h2>There's a few things we'd love to do as updates if the game is successful. For example:<br><br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Splitscreen division racing. We\u2019d like to expand the splitscreen mode to a multi-part challenge where you\u2019d race a series of races from a division of the main career league counting points between them and finally announce a winner after the series has been completed.<br></li><li>We'd like to make our own editors available to let you make tracks, leagues, cars and opponents and share with the community in a Roadclub Workshop. We can't promise it will be included in the final game yet. If you show your enough support for this we might go for it!<br></li><li>More achievements (there are just 3 at launch to test the ability, which we know is way too few for a game like this).<br></li><li>More tracks<br></li><li>More cars<br></li><li>More something else you\u2019d like to see?</li></ul><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">A little note about feedback</h2>My day job (Benny) is working as a frontend developer where listening to user feedback is key to designing successful user interfaces and getting happy users. We are just as serious about this here and will listen to all your thoughts and take them to heart. Still, as any good designer knows, the final decision on what changes needs to lie with the designer or you\u2019ll end up with a mess created by a mass of wills. That said, you\u2019re doomed if you aren\u2019t listening to your players and incorporating their comments if possible. So let us hear it! The good, bad and ugly - we want it all to make Roadclub the best game possible for you and frankly ourselves, you gotta love your creation or noone else will!<br><br>Thank you for playing Roadclub!",
