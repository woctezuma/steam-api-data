It has some fine artwork against attractive backdrops; as Alice would say \u201cwhat is the use of a book without pictures?\u201d Some occasional light animation livens things up. The musical tracks, while public domain, have been thoughtfully selected, and mesh rather well with the scenes they accompany.  The narration, and various voices for the memorable characters, succeed for the most part (they can be turned off if desired). All of these elements add together in bringing a further element of life to the fantasy.  Occasionally choices will pop up. The selections seem to amount to little more than potentially skipping small portions of the story, but they do add an element of interaction to a  style of release not known for such. I feel this is a very good title for fans of the original tale, fans of visual novels in general, and families.\u201d<br><a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=https://purenintendo.com/review-alice-wonderland-wii-u-eshop/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >Pure Nintendo (Wii U)</a><br><br>\u201cWhat I found was a great way to bring books to people in a whole new platform. It was exactly what you would expect, a book given graphics to tell the story. Controls were simple! It is not a game. I think visual novels sometimes get a bad rap because of incorrect expectations. You aren\u2019t playing at all. You are being presented a story. Keeping that in mind, I really enjoyed the experience. Real life backgrounds and colorful characters were something new. I could see this being perfect for young bookworms who have disabilities. But don\u2019t take my word for it, check it out.\u201d<br><a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://www.abilitypowered.com/alice-in-wonderland-wii-u-accessibility-first-look/\"
