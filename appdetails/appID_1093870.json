And use the number keys 1, 2, 3, 4 above to switch between different colors and use different capabilities.<br />\r\nOverall similar to the I wanna fa trap with a skill version.<br />\r\nAt present, the game is still in the semi-finished stage, and later will improve the game's art materials, music sound effects, and add game effects. If you have any good suggestions for the game, you can send an email to my email address. I will adopt good ideas and opinions. The final form of the game hopes to launch an edit mode, allowing players to freely design levels for other players to play (the top 100 users to buy, in order to express gratitude, I will consider adding special eggs for them in the later production ^_^)",
