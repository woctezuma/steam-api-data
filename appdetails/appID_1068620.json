This is additionally the case in marine science, which suffers from communication problems because many of its ecosystems are only directly accessible to coastal citizens, able scuba divers or aquarium visitors. The complexity of climate change and ocean acidification also makes it difficult for the public to grasp its scope. The Crystal Reef is a story that aims to reduce both of those access barriers.",

  "short_description": "Roughly 30 percent of the carbon dioxide produced by humans dissolves into oceans, rivers, and lakes. Stanford scientists have produced a 360-degree virtual underwater ecosystem to provide an up-close look at how coral reefs might appear by the end of the century if emissions aren\u2019t curbed.",
