To all of you who waited patiently for the series conclusion, we deeply appreciate your patience and support. The team here at Camouflaj put our hearts and souls into this epic final episode -- we hope you agree that it was worth the wait.<br><br>Just as we did with previous episodes, Episode 5: Terminus is not just an additional chapter but it comes with thousands of fixes and enhancements. Here\u2019s a breakdown of the major changes we made in addition to adding the fifth episode:<br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Improved performance, crash frequency, and optimized framerate for lower-end devices<br></li><li>Resolved issue where Hope falls out of the game world on some machines with AMD graphics cards<br></li><li>Fixed issues regarding Hope\u2019s trouble retrieving the EP3 cassette at beginning of episode, near desk in Reception Area<br></li><li>Unity default typeface no longer appears by default in certain prefabs (English alphabet only)<br></li><li>Improved and revised navigation, pathfinding, and collision in Episode 1-3<br></li><li>Improved camera rotation limits and view in all episodes<br></li><li>UI and pop-up improvements in all episodes<br></li><li>Updated 2D art for some scannable items in Episode 1-3</li></ul><br>In addition to the upgrades we\u2019ve made, here is some of the new stuff you can expect in Episode 5 (without spoiling too much):<br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><u>Hostile Cameras</u>: These new security cameras scattered throughout the game world will scan Hope and alert guards to her presence. Players can only inhabit them for a limited time, adding a neat layer of complexity to the gameplay loop.<br></li><li><u>Branching Paths</u>: This is something we\u2019ve kept close to the vest for a long time: EP5 has branching paths that change the course of the episode based on a decision you make early on. We don\u2019t want to reveal too much, but this is a huge addition that greatly expands the content offered in Episode 5, offering a nice incentive to play through the campaign again.<br></li><li><u>A New Metamorphosis</u>: Players are returning to the world of some previous episodes, but will find it looking and feeling much differently than before.
