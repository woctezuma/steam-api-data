Current owners of the game can participate in the OrbusVR: Reborn Closed Beta test following the instructions on our blog: <a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=https://blog.orbusvr.com/reborn-beta-6/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >https://blog.orbusvr.com/reborn-beta-6/</a> The game is not currently available to purchase, but will appear to buy on April 22nd.</p><br><h1>About the Game</h1>OrbusVR: Reborn is the first expansion to OrbusVR, the only MMORPG designed exclusively for room-scale virtual reality. It features everything you love about an MMO: a huge open world, over a hundred hours of quests following an intriguing story, interesting lore and characters, dragon pets, five-player group dungeons, world bosses, voice chat, player trading, fishing and crafting, and more! Plus you'll be part of a world brimming with thousands of other players.<br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li> 100+ hours of content, including new weekly missions in addition to Main Story quests<br></li><li> 8 unique classes: Ranger, Musketeer, Warrior, Runemage, Shaman, Paladin, Bard and Scoundrel<br></li><li> NEW dynamic scaling system, allowing veteran and new players to quest together<br></li><li> 4 major five-person dungeons, each with unique enemies and bosses with interesting mechanics<br></li><li> Improved monster AI for more challenging combat<br></li><li> Revamped open world PvP and NEW Battlegrounds<br></li><li> In-game voice chat, dungeon finder, fellowships, private messaging, and other socialization features to keep you connected to the world<br></li><li> Dedicated collaborative development process with a hands-on development team that cares about your feedback<br></li><li> Dragon pets, cosmetic capes, achievements, and much more!</li></ul><br><strong>Buy Once, Play Forever</strong><br>OrbusVR does not have a required monthly subscription fee! Once you've bought the game, you are able to play it as much as you'd like without paying us another dime. We don't have any &quot;Pay 2 Win&quot; in-app purchases or loot boxes, either. Ongoing revenue is provided via an in-game cosmetic with items such as mounts and cosmetic pets for sale. Our ongoing business strategy is to release yearly expansion packs that will cost an additional fee to unlock that new content, similar to other &quot;Buy to Play&quot; MMOs.<br><br><strong>Combat</strong><br>The combat of OrbusVR has been designed from the beginning to take advantage of room-scale VR. That means instead of just mashing buttons on an ability bar, you actually have to hone your physical skill to become more effective at combat.<br><br>For example, there's no tab-targetting for Rangers, who have to actually aim and hit targets with their bow. And for the Runemage, your ablity to cast spells is determined by how quickly and precisely you can draw the ancient symbols of runespeak. Whether you're looking for an up-close-and-personal, physically demanding melee role, or a more planned-out approach to combat via the musketeer's orbs, you'll find that combat in OrbusVR is unlike any other MMO you've ever played.<br><br><strong>Relax</strong><br>When you're ready to put down your sword for the day, you've got some great options available to kick back and relax. Fishing is a great way to pass the time and earn a little dram while you're at it. Just pull up a chair and see what fish are biting at Kingsport Lake. Maybe you'll break your record?<br><br>When you finish with that, you can enjoy your own personal Player House, where you can craft potions and age them in your cellar, patiently waiting for the right moment to use (or sell) them. Finally, be sure to spend some time enjoying the company of your pet dragon, who's always interested in what treats you might have for them to munch on.<br><br><strong>VR Support From the Beginning</strong><br><br>OrbusVR has been designed from the ground-up for desktop VR systems. As such we have full support for 180-degree (front facing) and 360-degree tracking setups. We've also got all kinds of great options for locomotion, including Teleport and Sliding, as well as the ability to customize your forward direction, smooth and snap turning, and even dual-joystick support for strafe/move and turn at the same time!<br><br>Note that for the absolute best experience, we do recommend a 360-degree tracking setup.",
