The punctuation has been a part of D&amp;D titles ever since ... except that the Dungeon Master's Guidetemporarily became the Dungeon Master Guidein 1995, losing both its apostrophe and its &quot;s&quot;!.<br><br>It appears that the name of the Dungeon Master's Guidealmost changed with the new release too.

However, it was once more a Guideby the time it was published.<br><br>Moving Toward AD&amp;D 2e. The second edition of Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons was the product of two and a half years of work from editor Steve Winter and author David Cook. The Player's Handbook(1989) premiered in February and after that AD&amp;D 2e game modules began to proliferate -- including edition-changing adventures like WG8: Fate of Istus(1989) and the Avatar trilogy (1989).

The new Dungeon Master's Guidefollowing the exact same pattern of production as the new Player's Handbook: it saw more than 10 printings over its first several years, then was revised as part of AD&amp;D 2.5e (1995), and more recently was published yet again by Wizards of the Coast (2013) in a premium edition.<br><br>A Different Sort of Dungeon Master's Guide. The original Dungeon Masters Guide(1979) was the core rulebook for AD&amp;D first edition. But now, the Player's Handbookhad become the core rulebook for the second edition game. So, for the first time ever, TSR had to ask itself: what should reallygo in a book for the Dungeon Master?<br><br>Like the first edition Dungeon Masters Guide, this new book's structure parallels the organization of its Player's Handbook: character abilities are followed by races, then classes, then alignment, just like in the Player's Handbook. However, one of Steve Winter's major goals for the 2e releases was that there be no repeat of material between the books. Thus the Dungeon Master's Guideinstead acts as a commentary and addendum to the Player's Handbook. It's filled with basic GMing advice and additional background on the various topics; it also contains yet more optional rules, including rules for creating new races and classes. These toolkit rules aren't the sort of thing found in more recent Dungeon Master's Guides, but they show off one of Zeb Cook's major goals for 2e: that the new rules be guidelines that players could adjust for themselves.<br><br>Magic items are the one truly coremechanic found in the Dungeon Master's Guide-- a division that D&amp;D has maintained through every edition of D&amp;D except 4e (2008). Artifacts can also be found, though with the lowest count ever. The scant three artifacts of 2e can be considered a list of D&amp;D's most interesting: the Hand of Vecna, the Rod of Seven Parts, and (somewhat more mysteriously) Heward's Mystical Organ. Second edition would correct its artifact deficiency several years later with the Book of Artifacts(1993), also by Cook.<br><br>What a Difference an Edition Makes. Most of the rules changes for AD&amp;D 2e had already appeared in the Player's Handbook, but there was one surprising take back: assassins reappear, not as a character class, but as a &quot;reprehensible mind-set&quot;. Though assassins are usually included in lists of the bowdlerized elements in AD&amp;D 2e, their slight inclusion here supports Cook's later statement that he removed them only because they were bad for party unity.<br><br>Many Appendices. The original Dungeon Masters Guidewas filled with well-loved appendices, including many wacky encounter tables and the famous list of inspirational reading. Steve Winter's article about second edition AD&amp;D in Dragon #126(October 1987) confirmed that there would be an appendix of &quot;useful tables&quot;, but it turns out to be all treasures and magic items.<br><br>It was perhaps an understandable change. The many and varied appendices of the first Dungeon Masters Guidewere a product of its chaotic creation as a stream-of-consciousness compendium.
