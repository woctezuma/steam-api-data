  "detailed_description": "Espire 1: VR Operative is an ambitious new virtual reality game and IP with its sights firmly set on the single-player \u2018stealth\u2019 genre, currently available through Steam's Alpha Release Channel in its prototype phase. We pitch this as &quot;Goldeneye 007&quot; meets &quot;Metal Gear Solid&quot; in an immersive VR world. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe prototype presents players with 6 of the game's 200 Virtual Challenges and a Sandbox Environment to test out the core stealth mechanics.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWith Espire 1, we're delivering VR's definitive Stealth Experience. Gone are the days of watching a super-spy hero on-screen: by leveraging the head and hand-tracked capabilities of current VR technology, players can physically live out their 007 fantasies as the Espire Model 1 Operative. These stealth mechanics cannot be replicated on another medium. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nPlayers assume the role of an Espire Agent - a drone operator of the future. From the safety of their &quot;Espire Control Theatre&quot; (sized to their Oculus Guardian Boundaries) they deploy the Espire Model 1 operative on assignments around the globe. The player then remote-operates Espire 1 from thousands of Kilometres away - the player's movement is translated 1:1 into that of Espire with less than 10ms of latency. The &quot;Control Theatre&quot; mechanic is not only a story component; it is used to minimize VR sickness whenever the player performs artificial movement. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe full game features 15 objective-based missions and 200 Virtual Challenges.",
