  "detailed_description": "<strong>Hinedere Beats: Jazzish</strong><br><br>The soundtrack for version 1.8 of Hinedere Beat. It\u2019s a compilation of remixes of songs that I made between 2010-2011 and released in two very short albums during that time period. The original versions of those songs all contained samples of music that I did not compose, perform, and record. For the versions of the songs that appear in-game, I removed all instances of samples that I did not compose, perform, and record before replacing them with pieces that I played using electronic instruments (including jamming the koto and shamisen with ps1/midi quality on my midi-keyboard and running them through effects to imitate a vinyl recording). Nearly everything that I did compose, perform and record was left alone.<br><br>Tracklist:<br><br>1. 2faded (Jazzish) - 01:14<br>2. Left Lanin' It (Jazzish) - 01:12<br>3. Out There (Jazzish) - 01:03<br>4. Turn (Jazzish) - 01:03<br>5. Cherry Blossom Funk (Jazzish) - 01:18<br>6. Fuzz Fused (Jazzish) - 00:54<br>7. Yep (Jazzish) - 01:24<br>8. Lose (Jazzish) - 01:40<br>9.

(Jazzish) - 01:13<br><br><br><strong>Hinedere Beat OST</strong><br><br>The soundtrack used for versions 1 and 1.4 of Hinedere Beat. Some of the tracks are chiphop remixes I've made of tracks I've composed and previously posted on my SoundCloud page and released in an album I originally made outside of game development under different titles.<br><br>Tracklist:<br><br>1.
