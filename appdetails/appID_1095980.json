  "detailed_description": "You play as a silent protagonist armed with a charge gun, and your ultimate goal is to progress through all levels presented by the game. Each level is a room that has only one exit, and your goal is to overcome any obstacles (such as humanly unreachable platforms or remotely-controlled closed doors) to reach that exit and progress to the next level.<br><br>To your help you have charge gun, cube and charge-proof walls (emitting light-blue segments). Charge gun is capable of positively or negatively charging cube and charge-proof walls. Depending on the charges applied, the interaction between them will be different:<br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>if cube and wall have opposite charges - cube will attract and eventually static cling to the wall;<br></li><li>otherwise (alike charges) cube will repel away from the wall.</li></ul>The closer those are, the stronger the effect.<br>There are major restrictions when it comes to charging objects:<br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>cube can either be positively OR negatively charged at the same time, or neutral;<br></li><li>only one wall charge of the same sign can exist at the same time, and applying new alike wall charge to another location removes old.</li></ul><br>You will need to figure out how to take advantage of these tools and manipulate objects to progress through. Almost every level forces you to learn a new way of using these tools, and some of the mechanics that you already learned in previous levels are mixed in.",
