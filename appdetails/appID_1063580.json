You begin with a starting deck of 10 cards, 5 in hand. Each turn you play <strong>gems</strong> to gain <strong>aether</strong>, which is used to buy new gems and <strong>relics</strong>, learn new <strong>spells</strong>, and increase your casting potential by opening additional <strong>breaches</strong>.

At the start of each round, the <strong>turn order deck</strong> is shuffled to determine the order of play. Will the nemesis go twice in a row, pushing back the mages\u2019 defense? Will the mages get 4 turns in a row to set up for the coming onslaught? It can be hard to know what\u2019s coming next when you are deep in the melee!<br><br>Finally, there\u2019s the city of <strong>Gravehold</strong>. The breach mages of Aeon\u2019s End are not just fighting for their own survival, but the survival of all of humanity, and the Nameless know it.
