You start in a single region, starting with a single facility. From there, you will expand to more complex products and more distant markets that will allow you to sell more than you could in a single place. The goal is to grow the business as much as you can over the tenure as CEO.<br><br>This is still in development, and will be receiving more features as we continue to develop it into the kind of game we feel it can be.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">A Great Globe</h2><br>Global Fortune is built around a hex-based globe, with the world divided into regions each with a central port. These regions can form larger markets, or be a market by themselves. They each have a resource richness rating for all natural resources, and many more statistics that will give every region a different set of challenges and advantages. Each individual tile is then further modified by local properties like climate or population density to give you boosts to different kinds of production.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Plenty of Production</h2><br>Production can be simple, exploiting a regions resource richness to harvest basic resources. Production can also be complex, involving chains of requirements where your factories transform one good into another with increasing complexity but increasing payout. These products can be built using one of many blueprints, creating different paths to getting the same goal. And each of these blueprints have a required skill that your factory has to meet, falling short can drastically hurt productivity.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Marvelous Markets</h2><br>The markets react to your actions, with the price dropping if you over-saturate them and slowly rising back up if they want more than what you're offering. Setting the right rate of sale can keep the price high, but limits your total profits.",
