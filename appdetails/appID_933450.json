You can switch between the two worlds with the touch of the button.It\u2019s a tactic that I\u2019ve seen used a few times in games recently, but it\u2019s one that works really well here and is employed perfectly.<br>It\u2019s tricky, but hugely rewarding when it works.<br>Should you be wishing for more from Wenjia, then there are a whole bunch of secrets to look out for and a ton of achievements to collect \u2013 both of these will give you an almighty challenge after the game is complete.\u201d                \u2014\u2014TheXboxHub<br><br><strong>\u00b7</strong>  \u201cWhen it comes to tricky platformers, Wenjia's world-shifting mechanic makes it unique\u201d                   <br>\u2014\u2014Video Chums<br><br><strong>\u00b7</strong>  \u201cI like the uniqueness that the swapping mechanic introduces because it keeps things fresh and it also makes you think about your next move.<br>There\u2019s a lot of diversity when it comes to the game\u2019s levels and the variety in the levels means traversing and completing them is a very enjoyable affair.\u201d                              \u2014\u2014Xbox_Alive<br><br><strong>\u00b7</strong>   \u201cFrom the overall gameplay, artwork, to the creativity of the levels behind Wenjia, these are all without a doubt its strongest attributes and sets it apart from what will be a 'no-doubt' comparison to Ori and the Blind Forest.<br>Overall, I enjoyed my experience with Wenjia. Although I didn't fall in love with the story, the core gameplay mechanics and artwork kept me intrigued and satisfied during my review experience.\u201d                       \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u2014\u2014Xbox Addict<br><br><strong>\u00b7</strong>   \u201cWenjia, a game that channels that Ori-vibe quite well, is one that I\u2019ve enjoyed sinking some time into.<br>I don\u2019t want to spoil too much, but using a blend of mechanics such as this, Wenjia stands out as unique in the midst of recently released platformers. It helps that the game does a good job at building on these mechanics from start to end.\u201d                       \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u2014\u2014XboxTavern<br><br><strong>\u00b7</strong> \u201cIn\u00a0the\u00a0beautiful\u00a0world\u00a0of\u00a0Wenjia,\u00a0we\u00a0could\u00a0see\u00a0abundant\u00a0landscapes\u00a0with\u00a0nice\u00a0details.\u00a0<br>Of\u00a0course,\u00a0a\u00a0pleasant\u00a0and\u00a0attractive\u00a0aesthetic\u00a0that\u00a0motivates\u00a0us\u00a0to\u00a0walk\u00a0and\u00a0jump\u00a0from\u00a0one\u00a0side\u00a0to\u00a0another\u00a0with\u00a0a\u00a0difficulty\u00a0level\u00a0increasing.\u00a0And\u00a0the\u00a0difficult\u00a0will\u00a0be\u00a0compensated\u00a0by\u00a0the\u00a0tranquility\u00a0that\u00a0the\u00a0beautiful\u00a0scenarios\u00a0give\u00a0us.
