The collection-elements in the game will affect the Ending of the game and unlock the skin.But  If you don\u2019t find them in the first round of the game,don\u2019t be worry,we suggest you collect them at second round of the game,that is a little hard for new player~~: )<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Reviews</h2><strong>\u00b7</strong>  \u201cthere is one other feature that separates this game from the other members of the pack\u2026See, the entire game world of Wenjia consists of parallel light and dark realms. You can switch between the two worlds with the touch of the button.It\u2019s a tactic that I\u2019ve seen used a few times in games recently, but it\u2019s one that works really well here and is employed perfectly.<br>It\u2019s tricky, but hugely rewarding when it works.<br>Should you be wishing for more from Wenjia, then there are a whole bunch of secrets to look out for and a ton of achievements to collect \u2013 both of these will give you an almighty challenge after the game is complete.\u201d                \u2014\u2014TheXboxHub<br><br><strong>\u00b7</strong>  \u201cWhen it comes to tricky platformers, Wenjia's world-shifting mechanic makes it unique\u201d                   <br>\u2014\u2014Video Chums<br><br><strong>\u00b7</strong>  \u201cI like the uniqueness that the swapping mechanic introduces because it keeps things fresh and it also makes you think about your next move.<br>There\u2019s a lot of diversity when it comes to the game\u2019s levels and the variety in the levels means traversing and completing them is a very enjoyable affair.\u201d                              \u2014\u2014Xbox_Alive<br><br><strong>\u00b7</strong>   \u201cFrom the overall gameplay, artwork, to the creativity of the levels behind Wenjia, these are all without a doubt its strongest attributes and sets it apart from what will be a 'no-doubt' comparison to Ori and the Blind Forest.<br>Overall, I enjoyed my experience with Wenjia. Although I didn't fall in love with the story, the core gameplay mechanics and artwork kept me intrigued and satisfied during my review experience.\u201d                       \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u2014\u2014Xbox Addict<br><br><strong>\u00b7</strong>   \u201cWenjia, a game that channels that Ori-vibe quite well, is one that I\u2019ve enjoyed sinking some time into.<br>I don\u2019t want to spoil too much, but using a blend of mechanics such as this, Wenjia stands out as unique in the midst of recently released platformers. It helps that the game does a good job at building on these mechanics from start to end.\u201d                       \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u2014\u2014XboxTavern<br><br><strong>\u00b7</strong> \u201cIn\u00a0the\u00a0beautiful\u00a0world\u00a0of\u00a0Wenjia,\u00a0we\u00a0could\u00a0see\u00a0abundant\u00a0landscapes\u00a0with\u00a0nice\u00a0details.\u00a0<br>Of\u00a0course,\u00a0a\u00a0pleasant\u00a0and\u00a0attractive\u00a0aesthetic\u00a0that\u00a0motivates\u00a0us\u00a0to\u00a0walk\u00a0and\u00a0jump\u00a0from\u00a0one\u00a0side\u00a0to\u00a0another\u00a0with\u00a0a\u00a0difficulty\u00a0level\u00a0increasing.\u00a0And\u00a0the\u00a0difficult\u00a0will\u00a0be\u00a0compensated\u00a0by\u00a0the\u00a0tranquility\u00a0that\u00a0the\u00a0beautiful\u00a0scenarios\u00a0give\u00a0us.
