Collect them all to unlock better ships, upgrade weapons and earn achievements.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Destroy</h2><br>There's no shortage of enemies in Dystoria with increasing amounts as you progress. Some, like you, are locked to the surface, some are not and will require clever piloting to line them up. Or if that's not your style, just buy a bigger gun.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Weapons</h2><br>Different weapons not only give you more firepower, they enhance the way you engage enemies. Can't hit those NATs and Seekers hovering over you? Get homing missiles and show them who's boss. Or better yet, clear the area with a proximity blast. Prefer to snipe from a distance? Equip a Speed Burst and Laser Canon. Prefer to go in with guns blazing? Rockets are your best friend.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Ships</h2><br>Choose from an inventory of 9 unique ships, unlocked by collecting salvage from your enemies destruction or by finding hidden pieces throughout each sector. Each ship has unique speed, maneuverability and shield, to fit your playing style.",
