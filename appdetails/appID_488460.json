  "reviews": "\u201cFor a point and click adventure game, Zeus Quest will please even the most skeptical of you. With comedy and humorous situations being its strong point, I could enjoy it even without a plot. It\u2019s so much fun interacting with characters and every funny dialogue is pure gold.\u201d<br>4/5 \u2013 <a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://www.download3k.com/articles/Greek-mythology-fans-unite-and-help-Zeus-save-the-world-in-Zeus-Quest-Remastered-01481\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >download3k</a></a><br><br>\u201cOverall, I can heartily recommend Zeus Quest Remastered as a brilliant addition to gaming. I really hope that it encourages other indie developers to follow in CrazySoft\u2019s footsteps, as I would love to see more graphic adventures.\u201d<br>90% \u2013 <a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://thesmartphoneappreview.com/reviews/zeus-quest-remastered-android-review/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >thesmartphoneappreview</a></a><br><br>\u201cClearly, Zeus Quest Remastered offers an adventurous and brainstorming way to spend your leisure. It also depicts a legendary epic figure of the Zeus the god of the ancient Greece. You should not only enjoy playing it but you should also learn about the historical practices it depicts.\u201d<br>9/10 \u2013 <a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://appsandapplications.com/tag/zeus-quest-remastered-app-review/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >appsandapplications</a></a><br>",
