On the far side of the sultry deserts of El Fior, a mighty mountain range aspires separating the deserts from the mysterious highlands of the Golden Lands. One of the peaks hidden high in the clouds has become a shelter for an ancient fortified abbey - the residence of the Order of the Shattering Light. Those who seek to visit the heights of the abbey would have to follow the only path that leads there, overcoming all obstacles, steeps and rocks. The path begins at a stone that reads \u201cOnly the fallen can rise\u201d. Those who found their way to the residence above the clouds, recognize the true meaning of these words. Gerhart, one of the strongest knights of the Order, learned their meaning too, but he paid a high price for that.",
