Reporter Bob Wilton (Ewan McGregor of ANGELS &amp; DEMONS, MISS POTTER) is in search of his next big story when he encounters Lyn Cassady (Academy Award\u00ae-winner George Clooney), a shadowy figure who claims to be part of an experimental U.S. military unit with unparalleled psychic powers that can read the enemy's thoughts, pass through solid walls, and even kill a goat simply by staring at it. Intrigued by his new acquaintance's far-fetched stories, Bob impulsively decides to accompany Lyn on his search to find the program's founder, Bill Django (Academy Award\u00ae-nominee Jeff Bridges). The reporter is trapped in the middle of a grudge match when the pair runs into renegade psychic Larry Hooper (two-time Academy Award\u00ae-winner Kevin Spacey) and his personal militia of super soldiers.
