Something diabolical, evil, growling, cruel. This is expressed in the frantic pace of the game. It really happens very quickly. Many corpses, blood, all kinds of torture, sadism, slaughter, etc.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBut immediately and secondly. This is a kind of banter over the first. Steb is not evil. Some kind of mockery of these moments. Yes, cruelty, bloodshed and corpses, but this is all drawn in a cartoon style and not at all scary, but vice versa. Yes, a lot of corpses, but they throw a goat at the time of death. Even the font used is not some kind of gothic, but one that is for comics. A lot of vulgarity and stupidity. Yes, maby it's not very good. But, well, it happened. There are toilets, and shit, and boobs, and all sorts of rude expressions, all sorts of silly names. It seems to me that there are even a couple of funny moments. For example, shekels with sidelocks. It's really ridiculous, after all) Shekels and with sidelocks) No anti-Semitism, by the way.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThese are, perhaps, two such basic feelings I wanted to express. Now about the material implementation.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nGraphics. I, of course, would like to say that the graphics are so beautiful, but no. The average is such a panache, and maybe even worse.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMusic. Here, in my opinion, things are better. Since I took a heavy music, which was created mainly by the masters of their work, the soundtracks are not bad. Another thing is that not everyone will suffer such severity. By the way, I wrote off with some bands, asked permission to use their music.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThere is no full story. But there are some hints. This is our lost civilization after the atomic war. The place of action is Russia. Something like that.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nResult. How would I rate my game? More than once the thought came to me that the game is ugly. Like Quasimodo. That this is such a big, huge pile of shit, where everything is mixed. Like a dump, where all sketched, and horseradish understand what's there. But I really liked it. Yes, can you imagine these?. Even manure is needed by farmers, and they are ready to pay for it. I understand that there are not very much farmers here, but, nevertheless, even such a product is offered. Being a farmer myself, I can say that the manure is of a very high quality. Yes. I declare with full responsibility. I did not bury the manure under the guise of candy, as many people do. But I will praise my manure, it is so fucking, smelly and savory. And if you need manure, then here it is.
