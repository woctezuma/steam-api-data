Inside the secluded borders of this land, an unholy court of vampires feast on the blood of their human subjects. And, as long as they give it willingly, a vicious peace between mortal and immortal is kept alive under the watchful eye of the vampiric rulers - Vlad and Cecilia Dracul, forever bound by eternal love.<br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1024480/extras/draculcastle.png?t=1560850325\" ><br><br>To the east, a cold wind blows over the desolate planes of Mourterra \u2013 The Land of the Dead.
