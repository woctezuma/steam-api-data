  "detailed_description": "<h1>OUT APRIL 5TH ON EARLY ACCESS</h1><p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>BUCKLE UP, BUTTERCUP: notmycar HITS STEAM EARLY ACCESS APRIL 5th</strong></h2><br>Exciting news, folks. We\u2019re gearing up to release vehicular battle royale game <strong>notmycar </strong>on April 5th! <br><br>It will be available for free on Steam Early Access come April 5th and we\u2019re hosting a Founders\u2019 Week  launch day through April 12th. If you play during the first week of the game, you\u2019ll get an exclusive custom paint job for <strong>notmycar\u2019s </strong>one and only pick-up truck of punishment \u2013 The Beast.  Stay tuned for more news to come until then!</p><br><h1>EARLY ACCESS FAQ</h1><p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Why Early Access?</h2>Early Access gives us the amazing opportunity to include a community of players in the development of <strong>notmycar</strong> from the very early stages. The chance to get feedback so early will allow us to make the best possible version of the game.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Approximately how long will this game be in Early Access?</h2>We are planning on being in Early Access for a minimum of 6 months. This time between Early Access launch and 1.0 will allow us to create new game modes, enhance existing and build new features, fine-tune driving and combat, develop in-game items based on player feedback (i.e. weapons, equipment, and abilities), and to scale up the number of players that can enter a match from 40 to 75+.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">How is the full version planned to differ from the Early Access version?</h2>The full version of the game is targeted to support the following:<br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>New game modes beyond Battle Royale<br></li><li>New vehicles<br></li><li>New weapons<br></li><li>New abilities<br></li><li>Prestige system<br></li><li>Additional 10k map<br></li><li>75-100 players</li></ul><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">What is the current state of the Early Access version?</h2>The Early Access version of <strong>notmycar</strong> is a Beta version. That means that the core functionality is up and running, but that there are still advanced features to add. There will be bugs in the Early Access version, and we hope the community can help us find and reproduce them.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Will the game be priced differently during and after Early Access?</h2><strong>notmycar</strong> will remain free-to-play after Early Access.</p><br><h1>About the Game</h1><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/694720/extras/image.jpg?t=1555522076\" ><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">BUCKLE UP, BUTTERCUP!</h2>notmycar is a white-knuckle, lead-footed multiplayer vehicular combat battle royale game.
