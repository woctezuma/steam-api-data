Do you like blowing up zombies to bits together with your friends? Protecting your base from the enemy team? Grab your gear and start the chaos!<br><br>Shoot 'm Up is a fast-paced tactical shooter with lots of different game modes. The game features a customizable server, offline playing, LAN and multiplayer action, custom maps (with a map editor), smooth gameplay, stunning graphics and awesome effects. You can currently try the Deathmatch, capture thhe flag, or team-deathmatch mode - just shoot at each other or at bots using one of the 18 different weapons; or you can jump into co-op zombie survival mode so you and your friends can hold off as many zombies as you can!<br><br>More game modes such as capture the flag, defend your base, realistic modes and more will be featured in the game in the future. The list of weapons will at least triple, and there will be more and more content in the sense of enemy-humiliating moves, zombie-shredding melee weapons, map-breaking vehicles and upgrades, and much, much more.<br><br><strong>Current features</strong><br>- Campaign mode (New episodes along the way!)  <br>- Co-op zombie survival mode <br>- Bots for PVE / PVP Deathmatch <br>- Team deathmatch <br>- Capture the flag <br>- Multi-team deathmatch <br>- Dedicated servers <br>- In-game server (play on your own server as others join) <br>- Offline gameplay <br>- Pistols, snipers, machine guns, dual-wieldable weapons, grenades, flashbangs, explosives, rockets <br>- Map editor <br>- Customizable server<br><br><strong>Planned features</strong><br>- Many more game modes (Bomb defusal, team base defender, king of the hill)<br>- Much more weaponry (C4, landmines, deployable turrets, airstrikes, killstreaks, melee weapons)<br>- Humiliating finishing moves<br>- Extended zombie survival mode (different waves / deployables / weapons / locations to go to / vehicles)<br>- More co-op PVE / PVP game modes<br>- Anything awesome you all can come up with :)<br>- Linux / Mac builds<br><br><strong>Development</strong><br>The game has been in development for the past few months, and I think I'm at a solid base. I've recently started the closed beta test, and so far the netcode is good, performance is good, and the overall reactions have been positive.<br><br>This doesn't mean it's done! The game will undergo updates as we go, from bugfixes to new content to performance improvements. I'm a solo developer that hates sluggish games, and gameplay is the number one priority for me. As long as the game runs smoothly without annoying bugs and glitches, I'm a happy man.<br><br>So far I've been making this game on my own, with testing help of the closed-beta community and the map-building skills from a friend. As Greenlight will be stopping soon, I'm putting this game on greenlight earlier than I'd like, but I wouldn't want to miss the chance to put the game up on Steam for everyone to enjoy.",
