Plus you can play to an audience with Twitch and Mixer interactivity that allows viewers to help or hinder your assault on the afterlife.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Ghost Writer</h2>Do you love 90's cartoons? Yeah, so do we, and we grew up on their stretchy squishy gross-out laughs. Our love for them spills over into the game like so much ectoplasm.

To top it off, the entire adventure is backed by music from the award-winning Will Morton (<i>Grand Theft Auto</i> series).",
