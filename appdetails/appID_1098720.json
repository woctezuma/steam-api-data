  "short_description": "Gather your wits and enter the council chamber. The king has fallen, but the five of you remain in the fight. You can mourn the loss of his majesty later; your own survival still depends on how you respond to this war. Undoubtedly, figuring out how to respond will be easier than convincing the others to listen.",
