Long ago, the kingdom entered an age of darkness and decay. Fog covered the land, as unrecognizable things crawled from both grave and crypt.

  "short_description": "Ruine is a sidescrolling fantasy RPG with roguelike elements and a souls-like setting. The world of Ruine is amorphous, its past long forgotten by most. Forests and ruins are inhabited by creatures that once lived, and now refuse to die. Use what you can find, craft or purchase to eradicate them.",
