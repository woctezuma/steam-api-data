  "detailed_description": "AntQueen 3D offers you the experience of playing through the cycle of an ant colony. Every spring, a few hundred ant queens will walk out of their hatching colony and attempt to found their own colony. The very first summer will give your new queen enough time to settle in and breed a few ants. Year after year, the empire will grow and the colony will gradually take control over a territory.   <br />\r\n<br />\r\nYou can breed 5 different ant classes each specialize for a task. Tiny nursers are best at taking care of the colony. Workers are fast and useful to gather food, but they cannot defend themselves very well. Diggers are strong enough to carry heavy load, but they move very slowly. Replete ants are able to store food in their abdomen to give the colony a surviving chance in time of drought. Solider ants are the very mandibles of the colony, they are fit to explore and hunt other insects, but they cost the colony a lot of food to maintain. Super Soldiers have a very strong exoskeleton and are set to defend the colony, but they are not suited for long distances.",
