There are three modes to play: a <strong>Time Attack </strong>(a two minute challenge), <strong>Survival </strong>(where you score bonus time for completing lines), and <strong>Timeless </strong>(where there is no clock at all, and you have a set number of turns instead).<br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1098250/extras/animatedgif1.gif?t=1559771841\" ><br><br>There is a fourth mode, called <strong>The Quest</strong>, which is a preview of a story I need to tell. How Grid Magic is real, and how we are all players in a game, until we choose to break the rules and make our own. I wonder if this description will be read, or understood. I hope so.<br><br>Besides, what's the point of being a technical witch if I can't wield some magic with your game?<br><br>If you want to pretend that all of this is marketing text, that's great.
