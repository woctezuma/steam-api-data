Just Flip is my latest and greatest!  <br>Like all my physics games, it gets to the point quick with minimal fluff and nonsense.  Just fire it up and start flipping.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">The Controls</h2>The controls in Just Flip are simplistic in concept, but require a little practice to get a feel for the inertia of the flip.  The launch and flip mechanic has been honed, tweaked, and iterated-on for over a year to make it smooth and satisfying.<br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1072750/extras/Steam2.gif?t=1561023617\" ><br>Just pull down and back sling-shot style anywhere on the screen and release to launch. Once in the air, mouse down to crouch or release to extend.  Stick the landing and repeat.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">The World</h2>Inspired by the world of Getting Over It with Bennet Foddy, Just Flip consists of a single large continuous mountain of stuff to flip over. You will not be artificially teleported back to the start if you fail to stick a landing, you will simply get back up and keep flipping. Of course, if you fail to stick the landing in the wrong place, gravity might have a say in where you end up.<br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1072750/extras/Steam3.gif?t=1561023617\" ><br><br>Now, get flipping over that mountain!<br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1072750/extras/BannerGif.gif?t=1561023617\" >", "about_the_game": "Launch yourself, parkour style, over a single massive mountain full of steep cliffs, long drops, and interesting obstacles.
