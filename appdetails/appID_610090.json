Well done ...my kids are looking for more levels :-)\u201d<br>5 stars \u2013 <a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=https://www.oculus.com/experiences/rift/1567888003236373/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >Ocili_HeiHeiLaiKa</a></a><br><br>\u201cI've had a lot of fun circumventing the gnomes talent for death-by-incompetence through the use of rube goldbergian tools and my 'magic' touch. At this price, the game is a great deal and I can't wait to keep playing the increasingly complex levels.\u201d<br>5 stars \u2013 <a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=https://www.oculus.com/experiences/rift/1567888003236373/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >avatizer</a></a><br><br>\u201cA really nice game. Reminds me of lemmings, which is great. The game works great in VR, the graphics are really nice and it is very addictive. Also, the price is right.
