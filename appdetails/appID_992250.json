  "detailed_description": "Gravityball is the 22nd century sport of fast reflexes and bent spacetime.  A mix of motocross and hockey, Gravityball is fast, exciting and always in motion.  Ride hoverbikes around a floating platform to capture the ball and launch it into the swirling vortex that is your opponents' goal.  The goals themselves have their own gravity, so close shots can be bent by or even orbit the goal until they score.  The games themselves are played in orbit around the various planets in our solar system, so try not to get distracted by the beautiful sight of Jupiter while you're driving in for the winning goal!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nGravityball games can be played by 2, 3 or 4 players in One-on-One, Two-on-Two or Free-for-all play.  Compete against your friends in a split-screen format, or against AI of varying skills.  Create Round-robin, Knockout or Group-format tournaments that are fully customizable.  Rack up stats and wins to earn achievements, rank-up your rider and unlock new features!",
