Like the SD40-2, the SDP40F was rated at 3,000 horsepower and powered by an EMD 645-series, turbocharged, two-cycle V-16 power plant. The big six-axle passenger diesel was wrapped in EMD\u2019s distinctive \u201ccowl\u201d carbody and, with steam generator and water tank, weighed in at nearly 400,000 pounds.<br><br>Amtrak\u2019s 150 SDP40Fs (Amtrak 500-649) rolled out of EMD\u2019s plant between June 1973 and August 1974, but the tenure of the big diesel was tarnished by problems including derailments at speed and Amtrak soon chose to build its diesel fleet of the future around the more versatile and nimble EMD F40PH. Amtrak would retire its last SDP40Fs in the early 1980s, but while the service careers of the SDP40Fs on Amtrak were relatively short, the big diesel nonetheless served a historic role for the passenger carrier and endured long enough to wear three Amtrak liveries (Phase I, II, and III), each of which are included in this DLC. As an extraordinary bonus, the Amtrak SDP40F pack, masterfully created by DTM, also include a complete set of Amtrak\u2019s ex-Santa Fe high-level cars as made famous in Santa Fe service on the El Capitan/Super Chief and Texas Chief, and which served Amtrak for decades.
