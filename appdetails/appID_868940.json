But we have created some pretty awesome stuff that we\u2019re proud of \u2013 art, environment, effects, magic system, interactions, and virtual presence \u2013 and we wanted to share it as soon as we could.  We hope you enjoy this little taste . . . and come back for the more adventurous entr\u00e9e later! <br><br><strong>So if it\u2019s not a game demo, what do I do?</strong><br>Whatever you like!  We created this virtual space for users to experiment with in VR.  Pick up items, interact with objects, maybe even try casting a few spells.  Keep an eye out for mysterious secrets, or Easter eggs that reveal more about our team and our development.
