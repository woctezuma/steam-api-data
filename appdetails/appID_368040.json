In addition, the more you fly and the more you shoot, the more Heat you generate and easier it will be for your opponent to find you and get weapons-lock.  If you can find your opponent first, you may get a crucial first strike and a fast kill.

Use missiles to drive your opponent out of the sky.  Use your Autocannon to bombard them on the ground. Use your Minigun to spray them at close range, or your Laser or Railgun to snipe them at a distance. Use your Plasma Rifle for the highest damage-per-second (if you're feeling accurate).  Counter Missile Swarms by launching Flares, keep your Heat low to avoid enemy lock-on, use your Jammer to further avoid detection.",
