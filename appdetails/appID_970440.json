Lovecraft wrote his classic tale of alien horror, \u201cThe Whisperer in Darkness.\u201d Lovecraft is now considered one of America\u2019s foremost writers of horror fiction, standing alongside the likes of Stephen King and Edgar Allan Poe. His story, which blends horror and science fiction, relates the adventure of Albert Wilmarth, a folklore professor at Miskatonic University, as he investigates legends of strange creatures rumored to dwell in the most remote mountains of Vermont. Wilmarth\u2019s investigation leads him to a discovery of horrors quite beyond anything he ever imagined, and ends in a desperate attempt to escape the remote New England hills with his life and sanity intact.\r\n\r\nThe H.P. Lovecraft Historical Society adapted Lovecraft\u2019s story as a feature-length motion picture, shooting it in the style of the classic horror films of the early \u201830s such as Dracula, King Kong and Frankenstein. As with their previous silent movie adaptation of Lovecraft\u2019s The Call of Cthulhu, the HPLHS used their MythoscopeTM technique to evoke the look and feel of early cinema. This production shot on location in Vermont, New Hampshire and Massachusetts to authentically capture the actual locations depicted in the story. A cast of Los Angeles actors, including Matt Foyer and Barry Lynch, bring the sweeping period tale to dramatic life. The result is a motion picture (a talkie, no less) that expands Lovecraft\u2019s short story into the kind of thrilling cinematic experience that Lovecraft himself might have enjoyed in 1931.",

  "reviews": "\u201cUltimately Branney nails the spirit of Lovecraft. Through voice-over narratives and frightened faces, &quot;The Whisperer in Darkness&quot; conveys a sense of human sanity being unraveled by too much forbidden fruit. By film's end, Foyer has the Thousand Yard Stare down to a science. His once-doubting Wilmarth has picked from the Tree of Knowledge, and become a reluctant believer.\u201d<br>5/5 \u2013 <a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://filmthreat.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >Film Threat</a><br><br>\u201cYou are about to encounter what very well be the single most successful H.P. Lovecraft adaptation ever to lick fear across a screen. Shot with an aesthetic, production design and performance style angled to emulate the feel of '30s/'40s Universal horror film - without falling into camp - WHISPERER arrives like shadows out of time, a discovered relic from another dimension. A genuinely scary film and a hellishly great time.\u201d<br>5/5 \u2013 <a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=https://bloody-disgusting.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >Bloody Disgusting</a><br><br>\u201cThe Whisperer in Darkness is a hell of a fine film, one of the best adaptations of a Lovecraft story ever made, and it's far superior to the vast majority of bigger-budgeted films that have &quot;H.P. Lovecraft's&quot; before their titles. Whisperer is faithful to a fault to the source material. What changes it does make a very welcome and actually enhance the story, as opposed to just padding things out, like so many other movies based on Lovecraft's short stories do. It is an obvious labour of love and, when movie makers care this much, it shows in every frame of the film. If you're a fan of H.P. Lovecraft, then this is MANDATORY VIEWING. If you've never read anything by HPL and always wanted to see what all the hoopla was about, this is a great place to start to get a handle on his unique and genre-changing brand of horror.\u201d<br>5/5 \u2013 <a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=https://www.innsmouthfreepress.com/blog/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >Innsmouth Free Press</a><br>",
