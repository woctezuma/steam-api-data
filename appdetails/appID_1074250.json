  "detailed_description": "Kunoichi is an entertaining and casual action game in the style of the loved samurai and ninja stories of the feudal Japan. In it, the player takes on the role of a ninja girl - a Kun\u043echi who has to stand up with his katana against countless enemies. As the player advances in the game, new, more dangerous enemies with different weapons and attacks appear against whom they have to use different tactics of attack or protection. Some enemies, like a samurai or a ronin, are armed with a sword and can only attack from close range, while others such as a ninja and archer attack the player from a distance with various throwing weapons and arrows. The objective of the game is to achieve the highest possible score and collect gold by killing enemies before you yourself get killed by them. With the gold you earn, you can acquire and upgrade different ninja skills, such as super fast, smoke curtain, and time delay.",
