Definitely wouldn't want to go older/lamer than that, but the fact you're actually looking at 3-dimensional games on Steam makes me think you've probably already got that covered. But it is quite important that your graphics card supports DirectX 11. Things can get a little wonky on DX10.<br></li><li><strong>DirectX:</strong> Version 11<br></li><li><strong>Storage:</strong> 500 MB available space<br></li><li><strong>Sound Card:</strong> As far as I can tell, any on-board chip should work. At least, none of the test machines I have access to have had any problems with sound.</li></ul>"
