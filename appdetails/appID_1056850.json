The key focus was to give the player an open and freely explorable environment but to also experience the beauty of the night without any horror elements that usually come with them. The goal was to recreate past real-life experiences where we would stroll many times in the night, coming to ideas, thinking about the world and coming to realizations of our own. <br><br>Features:<br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>open designed Island and many places to visit<br></li><li>easy to play, no time or difficulty limits<br></li><li>discover some beautiful, natural but also surreal phenomena of the night<br></li><li>enjoy a long and calming piano soundtrack<br></li><li>only you are on the island and there is really nothing that will scare you</li></ul><br>This game is still in an early development stage",
