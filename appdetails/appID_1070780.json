Once both flags are gone, you lose. To make things worse, if someone dies on your team, your whole squad's respawn timer goes up. Around here, <strong>the better team wins</strong> - not the better player.<br><br>Because of this, you're gonna need top notch communication. If your team pushes for a flag too soon, you risk running up your respawn timer. Push too late and that might just cost you the game. <br><br>Move together.
