Due to a shortage of real warriors, your goal is to tame the entity that harbors itself within the center of your planet. These entities are known as Skyes: youthful beings in dire need of guidance and protection. As you explore the world, you will face many obstacles and, in time, the evil tyrant who is ready to steal control of the Skye before you do. Forget what you know about the traditional turn-based RPG--these intense battles allow you to be in control 100% of the time. Whether you are using Chain Techniques to cut an enemy off or deflecting attacks entirely in real-time, expect to be kept on your toes. In addition to the 2.5D world, the game is packed with comedic dialogue and unexpected outcomes. Every character and situation you come across will change the way you look at hero quests and give you a thrilling sense of change.
