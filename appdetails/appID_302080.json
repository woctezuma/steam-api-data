  "reviews": "\u201cBus Driver is one of the most unique games I've played for a long time strictly because it\u2019s a realistic bus driving simulation and on top of that, it\u2019s actually fun. If you\u2019re looking for a fresh gaming experience and you\u2019re not afraid to try something new, I highly recommend this game.\u201d<br>8 \u2013 <a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://www.cosmosgaming.com/gaming/gaming-reviews/bus-driver-pc/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >Cosmos Gaming</a><br><br>\u201cYou get penalized if you\u2019re too fast or too slow, or if the passengers are unhappy, or if you forget to use your blinker. This did not sound like the makings of a fun game.
