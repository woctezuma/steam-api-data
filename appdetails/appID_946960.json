For competitive players we have real time multiplayer competitions, daily and weekly top lists, long term player ranking and bowling leagues.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWhat players have said about Premium Bowling: <br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;Really great physics and just figured out today that you can do local multiplayer, which really makes this a great party game. It feels like real bowling and i'm just so happy that we have this on vr.&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;I have been looking for a realistic bowling game in VR for a couple years now and I have finally found it.&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;This is the best bowling simulation I have played. It is just great fun, alone or with friends online.&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;If you like bowling and own a vr headset this is a no brainer.&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;This game is the closest I think you can get to real bowling physics without physically throwing a bowling ball. A must buy for someone who enjoys bowling.&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;This is the real deal. We need to get visibility on this publisher as fast as possible, because they actually know how to create a realistic experience with real physics.&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;This game is weirdly realistic, and is hard to master, but easy to learn, just like real life bowling.&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;It absolutely meets all expectations. The hooking physics are amazing and you can pick different hooking balls and you can also change the oil pattern. The reactions are different on any of the setups you choose and that's how it is for regular bowling.&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;It's to VR bowling as ------ ----- ------ is to VR ping pong.
