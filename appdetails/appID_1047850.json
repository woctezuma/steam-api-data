As secret agent Wally the Narwhal, you must rob houses, break into stores, and complete other various contracts in order to collect money to save your family. Professor Wigglywams, an ex-spy and notorious criminal, has kidnapped your wife and son for a $5,000,000 ransom. Your mysterious partner-in-crime, an unnamed agent, will provide you with contracts and information - but it's up to you to complete them.<br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1047850/extras/Features.png?t=1554525949\" ><br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>You're a Narwhal, Wally</strong> - your horn is a blessing and a curse. It allows you to reach high up or distant objects, but be careful, because even slight contact with a fragile object will cause it to shatter instantly, leading to your arrest. Between contracts, you stay in a fish tank since you still need water to survive. Because of this, you always show up to contracts soaking wet - and wet means slippery.<br><br></li><li><strong>Comical stealth</strong> - Being spotted by cameras, motion detectors, or people will result in your cover being blown and you being apprehended. Breaking anything (and believe me, there is a lot to break) with your horn or body will result in immediate arrest. With these two drawbacks, your goal will not be an easy one to achieve.<br><br></li><li><strong>Seven base contracts</strong> - Throughout seven base contracts, you can earn money, gain experience, and inch your way closer to success. From your first house robbing to taking down Wigglywams Inc., each contract brings its own unique mechanics, obstacles, and objectives for you to encounter.<br><br></li><li><strong>Notoriety</strong> - As you progress, each completed contract will award you with a Notoriety bonus. Not only does your Notoriety level increase the amount of money you receive from completed contracts, but it also unlocks higher tiers of upgrades in the Black Market.<br><br></li><li><strong>Black Market</strong> - Come on, you didn't think there were only seven contracts, did you? In addition to new side contracts, you can buy upgrades, new game modes, and cosmetics in the Black Market using the money you've earned from previous heists.</li></ul><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1047850/extras/PlayItYourWay.png?t=1554525949\" ><br><br>We know there's a large community out there determined to torture themselves in meticulously completing games in the quickest amount of time possible.

By using the game's Black Market shop system, the player can use cash earned from previous contracts to either unlock side contracts or unlock upgrades.
