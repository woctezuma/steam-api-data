But when corporate downsizing leaves him and co-workers Phil Woodward (Academy- Award\u00ae-winner Chris Cooper) and Gene McClary (Academy-Award\u00ae-winner Tommy Lee Jones) jobless, he must redefine his life as a man, a husband and a father. Bobby soon finds himself enduring enthusiastic life coaching, a job building houses for his brother-in-law (Academy-Award\u00ae-winner Kevin Costner) that does not play to his executive skill set, and - perhaps - the realization that there is more to life than chasing the bigger, better deal. With humor, pathos, and keen observation, writer- director John Wells (TV's ER, TV's THE WEST WING) introduces us to the new realities of American life in this story hailed by The New Yorker as &quot;one of the year's best films.&quot;",
