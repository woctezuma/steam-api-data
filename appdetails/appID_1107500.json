It was published in July 1978 at Origins '78.<br><br>About the Title. A generation of young D&amp;D players probably expected to find a frost giant named Jarl in G2: &quot;The Glacial Rift of the Frost Giant Jarl&quot; (1978), and were confused to instead find the leader of the frost giants was named Grugnur. Jarl is of course a title for a Norse chieftain.<br><br>&quot;Glacial Rift&quot; is also the only one of the &quot;G&quot; adventures that leads off with a definite article (&quot;the&quot;).<br><br><strong>Origins (I): Off the Cuff.</strong> When Gygax started writing about giants, he was thinking only about a hill giant fort. He came up with the idea for a &quot;larger adventure&quot; as he worked and had the &quot;springboards&quot; for the other two Giants adventures (1978) and for the later &quot;D&quot; Descent series (1978) &quot;well in mind&quot; by the time he finished G1: &quot;Steading of the Hill Giant Chief&quot; (1978).<br><br><strong>Origins (II): Same 'Ole, Same 'Ole. Otherwise, &quot;Glacial Rift&quot; has the same origin as its predecessor, &quot;Steading&quot;.</strong> It was part of TSR's first series of adventures and one of its major sources was the &quot;heroic adventuring&quot; of The Incomplete Enchanter(1941) by Fletcher Pratt and L. Sprague de Camp. It was run as part of a tournament at Origins '78, then the adventure went on sale immediately following that round of play -- on the evening of Saturday, July 15th.<br><br><strong>About the Book.</strong> Like &quot;Steading&quot;, &quot;Glacial Rift&quot; is shockingly short: just 8 pages long!<br><br><strong>Adventure Tropes (I): From Dungeons to Caves.</strong> Though &quot;Steading&quot; featured a tradition dungeon, &quot;Glacial Rift&quot; is instead full of caverns -- which introduced players to the other natural source of dungeon-crawl style adventures. Beyond that, &quot;Glacial Rift&quot; is a very traditional dungeon crawl. Where &quot;Steading&quot; had some possibilities for cunning and guile, &quot;Glacial Rift&quot; is more likely to be a hack-and-slash from front to back.<br><br><strong>Adventure Tropes (II): Gygaxian Naturalism.</strong> &quot;Glacial Rift&quot; continues to depict another early D&amp;D trope, what James Maliszewski calls &quot;Gygaxian Naturalism&quot;.  The entire adventure is set in a frozen terrain, and this is reflected in what's found there. Monsters include not just frost giants, but also winter wolves, white dragons, and the otherwise unknown white puddings. One can imagine an entire winter ecology.<br><br><strong>Exploring Greyhawk.</strong> &quot;Glacial Rift&quot; is set in the World of Greyhawk, but as with &quot;Steading&quot;, you wouldn't really know it from the adventure, which is said to be set &quot;amidst the tallest mountain peaks&quot;. Later publications would more precisely place it in the Crystalmist Mountains (hex S5-134).<br><br><strong>Monsters of Note.</strong> &quot;Glacial Rift&quot; is the big spotlight for frost giants, who are obviously derived from Norse mythology, where they're called the Jotun (or J?tnar). The king of the Norse frost giants, Hyrm, had already appeared in OD&amp;D Supplement IV: Gods, Demi-Gods &amp; Heroes(1976).<br><br>&quot;Glacial Rift&quot; is also notable for featuring the first dragonsin an official D&amp;D adventure -- the aforementioned white dragons.<br><br>About the Creators.Gary Gygax originally wrote these adventures in the middle of creating AD&amp;D.
