  "reviews": "\u201cIt\u2019s wholly possible that\u00a0Evasion\u00a0could become the\u00a0Borderlands\u00a0of VR; a unique twist on the FPS genre that would most certainly be welcome. [\u2026] If the development team can come good on the promise of a deep character evolution system and the promise of varied locomotion alternatives is realised,\u00a0Evasion\u00a0could well achieve its goal of becoming a landmark VR FPS title.\u201d<br><a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=https://www.vrfocus.com/2017/10/preview-evasion-vr-cant-do-fps-tell-that-to-archiact/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >VR Focus</a></a><br><br>\u201cIt\u2019s hard to really communicate why Evasion feels so much more intense than other similar games, but it\u2019s noticeable very quickly. [\u2026] Dodging and shooting while physically moving around is super exciting to experience.\u201d<br><a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=https://uploadvr.com/hands-evasion-wants-go-co-op-bullet-hell-shooter/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >Upload VR</a></a><br>",
