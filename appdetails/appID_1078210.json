Scan the environment for hidden secrets and tinker with the old radio technology in the search for answers. Listen to countless weird transmissions and follow the narrative dots through to know what forces you're actually against or who you are.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Build</h2><strong>Create your base piece by piece from a flexible system of construction blocks.</strong><br><br>Find the fragile balance between economy and defense. Scavenge for resources and think twice how to spend them. Acquire new construction blueprints and find your favorite synergies. Master the physics to speed up your construction times and minimize costly errors.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Survive</h2><strong>Defend against endless assaults. Make your last stand in a world beyond salvation.</strong><br><br>As if the harsh conditions weren't enough, your base gets regularly attacked by all kinds of mechanized enemies.
