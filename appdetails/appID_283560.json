  "reviews": "\u201c&quot;There aren`t that many bus simulators out there,but this one, the CBS2: Munich, is one of the best and most real bus simulators I`ve seen. It has excellent graphics, a great sound and a high level of detail and realism. I recommend this simulator for all bus lovers and to people that want to try something different than only transport people through air.&quot;\u201d<br><a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://asn.aerosoft.com/?page_id=18123\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >Review by <a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://asn.aerosoft.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >asn.aerosoft.com</a> (ASN)</a></a><br>",
