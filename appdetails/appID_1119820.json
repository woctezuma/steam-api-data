Luckily, there are few casualties and the atmosphere is survivable, but they soon discover that in exactly 61 days the temperature is set to plummet to unbearable cold.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTheir only hope lies with an expedition a century ago, which perished but managed to use alien technology to build fuel cells to generate heat and power. Now the clock is ticking to find these artifacts and use them to build a base that will help you brave the winter.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nUltimately, your goal is to collect these energy cells, but along the way you will face platforming challenges as well as puzzle and fighting segments. You will also frequently have to make decisions, sometimes as the ship's captain, that will affect the health of your colony and your overall chances of survival.",
