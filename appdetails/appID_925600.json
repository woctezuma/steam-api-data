Visit Dry Plains, Central Forest and Snow County, but be careful, don't go to the Hazardous biome or the gas will kill you within seconds. Hunt Matacinas, kill as much as you can. Go looting and search every single dropped loot, in order to gather enough items. Chop trees, mine rocks, dig earth to gather resources. Craft tools, building blocks and decorations, and build your dream house in the middle of an apocalypse. <br><br>All these in just two words: Freedom and Hazard.<br>Who said that a world full of dangers and death can't be fun?<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Short Story</h2>In the world's greatest war of all time people were despairingly looking for the perfect soldiers. In the Delta Genetycs Research Facility the scientists created a DNA that was believed to be the DNA of perfect humans, but they made a huge mistake... They have created the Matacinas. The chemical warfare left a deadly gas behind that killed most of humanity and Matacinas killed almost everyone who left. Survivors got sheltered in underground bunkers, except one survivor... Daniel Jackson. You are Daniel who is the only human survivor on the surface. You wake up in Stall Valley the only place with clean air. The governments of the old world hid the Machine somewhere in Stall Valley...<br><br>IMPORTANT NOTE: Please note that Afterlifes is still in an early alpha stage. This means that most of the planned features are not present yet and bugs might appear. If you find any bug or you just have an idea for a new feature or update, please contact us.",
