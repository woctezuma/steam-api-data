The research was going well, so Trump cut the funding. Not his fault! Now Charon is bringing back dead Mayans, Aztecs, and Incas. Not that Trump can tell the difference. You have to stop them by killing zombies, fighting Charon, throwing rubber duckies down slides, and just make it through this crazy cruise ship/government research facility you are on, so you can blow up the south american temples and win the game.",

Hitting an enemy produces blood spray. You can shoot missiles at hydra's, which will produce an explosion. There is also a bdsm room in the game that contains some dildo's. None of the equipment in the bdsm room is used by players."
