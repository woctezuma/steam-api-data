The levels take the shape of a gigantic circle. The station map is procedurally generated on each playthrough, with floors that are actually curved. Because of its circular shape, if you run far enough in one direction, you will end up back where you started.<br><br>Because the station spins to generate gravity, the closer you get to the center, the less the gravity affects you. The station also has an inner ring that doesn't spin, where you have to navigate by jumping from wall to wall.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">A control scheme for emergent physical interactions</h2><br>Because the setting of the game has varying gravity, we leaned into the physical nature of all the interactions<br><br>All objects in the game are physics objects. You can pick them up and throw them, so that they tumble along the ground and smash into enemies. You can release a knife in mid-air, it will fly across the room, and slash the wires that power security systems.

The arm follows your mouse, and lets you do things not possible in most platformers.<br><br>You'll find toys that interact in interesting physical ways. Fans that let you hover in place, bunsen burners to start fires, or acid to melt through walls.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">What's the matter?</h2><br>You're an escaped 3D printer with legs.
