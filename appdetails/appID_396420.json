Can you change Hermans fate, and give him a chance for another day among the living? <br>By learning the rules of the world beyond, you will gain the skill and the wit to take precious \u201csoular power\u201d from the living. By using this power and pouring it into your former meat shell you get a chance to live once more.<br>But things on the other side are seldom this easy.
