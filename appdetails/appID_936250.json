  "detailed_description": "Welcome to Catsbridge!<br><br><strong>'Catsbridge Stories'</strong> is a detective simulator set in a cat city. Play as Nathan Chrono, a private investigator, who solves every crime in <i>12 hours</i>.<br><br>To find the criminal you need to collect information piece by piece, and then put everything together to reveal the truth. There are several ways to search for the information:<br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li> Search the crime scene in the isometric mode - it\u2019s just like playing hot-and-cold;<br></li><li> Look for additional clues at the locations you visit by clicking on various objects;<br></li><li> Talk to the cats related to the crime and to the victim;<br></li><li> Compare collected facts to gain new pieces of information;</li></ul><br>Every meaningful action moves the clock\u2019s hand a few minutes forward, but engaging in conversations with other characters does not affect in-game time. So you won\u2019t have to exercise in speed reading, but you might wanna think ahead and <strong>plan your actions thoroughly</strong>.<br><br>Having <strong>conversations</strong> with other characters is one the key elements of the game. They are the major source of information. It\u2019s important to ask the right questions, refute lies by using facts, and sometimes trick the other cats, manipulate and provoke them into giving away their secrets. <strong>Find the truth!</strong><br><br><strong>You are the one solving the crimes</strong> - your character does not do it for you. Investigation has <strong>nonlinear elements</strong>. For example, you can make a mistake and accuse an innocent suspect, or you can detect the criminal in several ways. Also, some of the events in the game aren\u2019t directly corresponding with the story, they just happen at certain locations at a certain time. Thus, you can finish every chapter in <strong>several ways</strong>, and with a different result.",
