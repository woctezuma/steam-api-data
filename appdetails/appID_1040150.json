This game hides and obfuscates as much as it possibly can. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nA puzzle game would give you mechanics and expect you to solve something. <br />\r\nThis game lies to you and gives you nothing to go by. Once you figure out what you have to do, the rest of the game is trivial.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nA puzzle game is clever, fair and self-contained. <br />\r\nThis is obtuse and dumb. Once you figure out the subject matter, you have to an internet search to solve the rest of the game. You cannot solve the game without knowledge of certain things which are not presented in the game itself.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThere is an A-HA moment though but I don't expect everyone to decipher it. Once the secret is revealed, there won't be a point in playing this game. So stay away from spoilers in the comments, if you want to try this yourself.",
