Ever wanted to pause that song you're listening to without fumbling around on your keyboard? Now you can with ease!<br><br>OVR Toolkit is compatible with mostly all SteamVR compatible headsets, though it does require tracked controllers too!

(This makes a lot more sense than it sounds like it does!)<br></li><li> Wristwatch: An overlay displayed on your hand that displays the time, date, as well as Vive/Index controller/Tracker battery percentages, as well as other values such as Vive Wireless temperatures.<br></li><li> Saving/Loading configurations: Like that sweet setup you've made? Well now you can save it, and load it again next time you launch!<br></li><li> Advanced settings for window capture: Really want to capture a window at 60FPS instead of 30? Want to make a window slightly transparent so it's less in the way?

(If you're the only user of your PC, this is probably you)<br></li><li> OVR Toolkit only supports Windows 10. (This is due to the desktop capture API we use which was only introduced in Windows 10)<br></li><li> Oculus' software will sometimes overlay over our overlay. (This is because Oculus' software displays separate to SteamVR, our application will always display whilst SteamVR is active or you're playing a SteamVR game, just not when you open the Oculus Dashboard)<br></li><li> We cannot display our application over Oculus SDK games. (Our application uses SteamVR to display, though, most Oculus games will have a SteamVR mode, we advice you use this!)</li></ul> If you have any issues with the application or find other comparability issues, don't hesitate to contact us!
