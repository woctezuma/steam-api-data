  "reviews": "\u201cI\u2019m quite impressed with Eden Rising as an Early Access title. Too often these games just feel half-baked when they hit steam. Instead, Nvizzio\u2019s open world tower defense is a delight, polished, and feels really engaging.\u201d<br><a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=https://www.mmorpg.com/columns/eden-rising-supremacy-early-access-review-1000012727\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >MMORPG</a><br><br>\u201cIt's got a gorgeous science-fantasy art style, is being developed by industry vets who've worked on games like The Secret World and Age of Conan, and has some intriguing ideas about how to revive a genre that's long been cold.\u201d<br><a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=https://www.gamesradar.com/eden-rising-supremacy-mixes-the-craft-anywhere-attitude-of-fortnite-with-the-combat-of-a-science-fantasy-rpg/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >Gamesradar+</a><br><br>\u201cThe team at Nvizzio Creations is hoping to have Eden Rising out of early access by the end of 2018. If it uses that time well, putting polish on this game and smoothing out all its edges, this really will be my favorite game all year.\u201d<br><a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=https://www.spritesanddice.com/2018/05/eden-rising-early-access-review\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >Sprites and Dice</a><br>",
