Success lies at the intersection of strategic tower defense and fast-paced 3rd player combat. With a range of settings to amp up the difficulty, the challenge won\u2019t just come from killing these space invaders, but also how you choose to off them. Get creative with In Defense of Aliens and experience lush battlefields, unique worlds, and 4 character types each with their unique play style and progression systems.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">BACKGROUND</h2>Development of this game started more than 5 years ago as a way to teach my two sons and my daughter about programming. As a family, we were hooked on Dungeon Defenders and my son was obsessed with drawing alien creatures. We mashed them together with a father's desire to show his kids that they could not only play video games, but they could also learn to create them, and that was the original genesis of our game. Fast-forward to present day and my sons are at college (one studying Computer Science and the other Business with a CS minor) and this game has become a passion project for me and my daughter (still in high school). We've been fortunate to enlist the help of some great indie-friendly artists, animators, developers, sound engineers and an amazingly supportive community on our discord server. <br><br><br>It's been an incredible family journey and we're excited to share our creation with the world!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">KEY FEATURES</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>MULTIPLE CLASSES:</strong> 4 unique classes each with 3 abilities, 7 towers, and 4 weapons<br></li><li><strong>TACTICAL CONTROL:</strong> Keyboard+Mouse and <i>FULL</i> game controller support<br></li><li><strong>PLAY WITH YOUR PALS:</strong> Upto 4 of you and your most heroic buds can team up and play online or just you and your bestie can play on one machine in local coop split screen mode<br></li><li><strong>SHOW \u2018EM WHO\u2019S BEST!:</strong> Get creative with your kills and build up huge combos for points.
