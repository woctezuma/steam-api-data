  "detailed_description": "Infected by a zombie bite, Anling's days are numbered. She must now fight to survive, not for herself but her young son, Cody. Ensure Cody's survival in this zombie infested world by protecting him, searching for safety, and teaching him valuable skills, at any cost. Even if it means giving in to her new zombie urges. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn this survival game players take control of Anling whose goal is to find somewhere safe for her son Cody to live on before she is turned by her infection. Limited resources must be managed in order to slow down Anling\u2019s infection while also making sure both Anling and Cody don\u2019t starve from hunger or thirst. In order to be more efficient and to help Cody in the future, players can pass on skills that Anling has learned over to Cody. These skills can be in combat as well as general survival skill such as cooking and crafting. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nA perfect balance of managing your days looking for resources and increasing Cody\u2019s skill set will be needed in order to survive the long journey.",
