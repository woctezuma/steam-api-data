Use each hero's rage ability when it's fully charged to lay waste to your enemies. Timing is important.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFight Powerful Bosses<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThere are many unique bosses, each with their own abilities that you must learn to counter.

Let him battle while you collect gold. Level up your hero and recruit new heroes as they become available.  Keep battling and leveling up.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n- Eventually the monsters will become very difficult. This is a good time to leave and come back a bit later. You will still collect gold even when you aren't playing, so when you come back you can level up a ton and progress very quickly.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n- Once things are really difficult, tap the Portals tab and use the Portal of Renewal. This is the 'prestige' system. You will reset to stage 1. Your heroes will reset to level 1, however you will gain shards. Use these to rank up your heroes, giving them extra power.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n- Just keep doing this over and over.  This is the nature of idle games! They are really fun.  There's lots of other things to do also, explore the game!  The frontier is endless, see how far you can get!<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nNote: This game DOES have in-app purchases, but we make sure to give away tons of gems for free. You get gems for beating bosses and completing hero quests (there are over 1,500), plus there are free gem boosts you get every day just for showing up. As long as you don't go crazy with spending gems you should always have enough to buy some boosts.", "about_the_game": "Recruit heroes and idle your way to glory!
