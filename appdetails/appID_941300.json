No doubt such stupid behavior will definitely result in a tragedy. Look! Reimu and Marisa are coming to teach her a lesson.<br><br>What is different is that Reimu and Marisa use dummies called \u201cNil Souls\u201d to defeat opponents this time. Come on! Let\u2019s choose your soldiers , pick up your weapons , dodge opponents\u2019 bullets and beat them down.<br><br>We firmly believe that this brand new scarlet mist anomaly will keep company with you during your playing of about 20 hours.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">1.A unique system including turn base and barrage \u2014 turn-based barrage system.</h2> <br> <br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/941300/extras/gameIntro01.jpg?t=1553275040\" ><br><br><u>1-1 What is the turn-based barrage system?</u><br> <br>To cut a long story short, it is a system syncretizing turn-based game and barrage. A system in which the barrages will move according to preset trajectory after players complete operation. A systemwhichletsplayersthink twice before every character\u2019s every step so that their characters won\u2019t be hurt by changing barrages. So this unique system requires players to have the ability of deducing situation they will face after several rounds and scan changes of battlefield in the dynamic perspective.Just think about how you try to guess your friend\u2019s next step when playing chess, then you may understand the system better.<br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/941300/extras/gameIntro02.jpg?t=1553275040\" ><br>\u25b2 This turn-based barrage system nearly like this in the game.<br><br><u>1-2 How can I enjoy the turn-based barrage system?</u><br><br>The answer is the diversity of barrage itself. In this aspect, TouHou Project\u2019s official games and other barrage games have given us a lot of reference. Barrages in the game can be classified as:<u>regular barrages</u>,<u>random barrages</u>,<u>tracking barrages</u> and <u>blocking barrages</u>.Meanwhile, bosses\u2019skills can add more changes to barrages. Let\u2019s see two examples. Rumia can hide barrages, which means palyers can\u2019t see her barrages completely. As a result, players have to deduce trajectory of barrages according to their acquaintance with barrages and then dodge them. Hon Meirin is good at knockback, so chances are that even if players have dodged barrages, Hon Merin can still use her skills to beat them back to the area surrounded by barrages or even to a barrage. We hope that we can combine bosses\u2019skills with rules of barrages to create more plentiful experience.<br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/941300/extras/gameIntro03.jpg?t=1553275040\" ><br>\u25b2 Tetris barrages?

As for the third way, players\u2019 characters will have the ability of eliminating barrages. For example, we design some skills which allow players to eliminate barrages in a certain area, and some spell cards which can attack bosses while eliminating barrages in a large area. We believe that properly using skills of eliminating barrages while attacking bosses, together with barrage itself, will create something interesting. We hope we can make the system more attractive as possible as we can.<br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/941300/extras/gameIntro04_e.jpg?t=1553275040\" ><br>\u25b2 Oh~ my friend, are you annoyed with being surrounded by barrages?

The reason why we design this mechanism is that we hope we can avoid letting players play one level repeatedly just for one specific item.<br></li><li> So far, each character has her private weapon but armors and accessories can be used universally<br></li><li> All dormant items you get from all levels will only exist before next time you get new dormant items. In other words, if you don\u2019t waken dormant items you get from the last battle during the period between the last battle and next battle, these dormant items will be replaced by new dormant items</li></ul><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/941300/extras/gameIntro18.jpg?t=1553275040\" ><br>\u25b2 fter you win a battle, you can get some dormant items in Kourindou. Since the \u2018Nil Soul\u2019 is finite, it deserves to think twice before wakening items.<br><br><u>3-3 System of levels</u><br><br>We design a map ranging from Hakurei Shrine to Scarlet Devil Mansion.What\u2019s more, you will see some special landmarks on this map, they correspond to battlefields in official games.Yes, those familiar opponents will challenge you when you exploring the map. Here is the explanation in detail about this system:<br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li> You can only unlock next area by defeat the boss of this area.<br></li><li> You can challenge every area repeatedly.<br></li><li> You will get random items from different area.<br></li><li> Story of each area will only be motivated the first time you challenge the area<br></li><li> What\u2019s more, we are trying our best to polish this aspect and enrich players\u2019 experience of exploring the map.</li></ul><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/941300/extras/gameIntro19.jpg?t=1553275040\" ><br>\u25b2 Once you\u2019ve explored the whole map, you will get a picture of part of Gensoukyo. By the way, we haven\u2019t designed this picture completely on the basis of official games.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">4.ther things we think we should display here</h2>  <br>  <br><u>4-1 Characters in the official game \u2018the Embodiment of Scarlet Devil\u2019 are all available.</u><br><br>Besides Reimu and Marisa, nine characters in \u2018the Embodiment of Scarlet Devil\u2019 will appear in our game. They will be unlocked with players\u2019 exploration of storyline.<br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/941300/extras/gameIntro20.jpg?t=1553275040\" ><br>\u25b2 The deblocking of two vampire bosses has some special conditions so we decide not to display their images here.<br><br><u>4-2 Humorous storyline</u><br><br>We fill this game with a great deal of stories. While enjoying the main line, we hope these stories can make you smile knowingly.<br><br>Yes, it is just a relaxing game, a pleasant game from the beginning to the end. So, you can motivate any story as you wish.<br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/941300/extras/gameIntro21.jpg?t=1553275040\" ><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/941300/extras/gameIntro22.jpg?t=1553275040\" ><br><br><u>4-3 Salute the original music\u2014\u2014Remix based on original music</u><br><br>In recent years, the mainstream of composing TouHou fan music is reshaping original music. Actually, we\u2019ve chosen a different way when we developing game music. We decide to use the remix adaption of original music (which is closer to original music). So far, we\u2019ve completed 23 songs. Well, that\u2019s not the end. This number is still raising.<br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/941300/extras/op.jpg?t=1553275040\" >",
