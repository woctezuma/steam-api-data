Unlike the main game, there's only one ending to achieve in Anniversary Mode, but the route to that ending is unlike anything you've experienced before.<br></li><li><u>Girl's Graveyard Challenge Mode</u>: Are you a masochist? Taking place after the events of Girl's Graveyard as a sequel of sorts, Challenge Mode is not for the weak of heart.
