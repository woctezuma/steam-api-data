Except this time things are different. This time the victim fights back. At first the pattern is familiar; Mick chooses an American family on vacation in northern Australia to terrorize and destroy, but that is merely the inciting incident in a much larger story. Seriously injured, 19-year-old Eve survives the massacre of her parents and little brother, recovers and sets out to bring the killer to justice. Across the 6 episodes we chart her complex and extraordinary journey, travelling every step of the way with her as she evolves from child to adult, from prey to predator. But can she triumph over Mick Taylor, evil incarnate?", "about_the_game": "Mick Taylor returns to wreak havoc in the long form drama series, WOLF CREEK.  Except this time things are different.
