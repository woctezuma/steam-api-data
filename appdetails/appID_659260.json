  "detailed_description": "Canvas Quest is a turn-based JRPG made in RPGMaker MV. The game features an artstyle based around poorly made digital and physical art, featuring stickman characters and an abundance of obvious perfect circles and lines.

His only real taste of action is the training he has just signed up for. When Bob comes home from Day 1 of training to find a note saying Suzy has been kidnapped by the &quot;Evil King,&quot; Bob rushes off to save his lover, meeting friends and foes along the way.<br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/659260/extras/hunt_down_strategies.png?t=1507134628\" ><br>Canvas Quest is a game where experimentation is heavily encouraged. New spells and moves that characters learn may be useless. They may only be useful in certain situations or when paired up with other moves or spells. They may even be super powerful and useful. It's up to the player to determine what works best, as nothing is certain to tell you the best strategy.<br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/659260/extras/Lol_dialogue.png?t=1507134628\" ><br>This is a game brimming with personality.

Dialogue will often subvert expectations to get a good chuckle out of you.

I might get a meal out of it. That'd be neat.",
