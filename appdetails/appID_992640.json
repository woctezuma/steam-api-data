As you become more battle-hardened, your renown grows and doors open for you \u2013 both to greater power and greater foes.  <br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/992640/extras/Crush_without_mercy.gif?t=1555611315\" ><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">A class for every player, a hero for every taste</h2><br>These aren\u2019t just your typical RPG classes!

From nomad knights to beastly abominations, they are familiar and yet like nothing you\u2019ve ever tried before. <br>Every hero has their own abilities, playstyles, and their own weapons and attacks, so you could be forgiven for thinking you\u2019re playing a different game when you take up arms as another hero. <br>Carry out devastating combos with skills in your repertoire and do whatever it takes to come out on top \u2013 leech the blood of your downed foes to stay standing, summon the might of Perun himself in a thunderfist, or channel the elements to unleash raw destruction.  <br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/992640/extras/Chars.png?t=1555611315\" ><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Your hero, your style</h2><br>If you\u2019re going to be looking at your hero constantly, you might as well look at something nice. A hero is a hero no matter what they wear of course, but you gotta admit, the deep red of a blood spatter would look so fetching on your green robes. <br>You can pick from a wide variety of class-specific armor sets for each hero. Not only can you upgrade and customize heroes to your liking, but you can also use unique skins and shaders so the enemy commanders will know exactly who is coming to end them.<br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/992640/extras/Your_hero_your_style.gif?t=1555611315\" ><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Wield weapons of legend</h2><br>Action RPGs can\u2019t work without loot.
