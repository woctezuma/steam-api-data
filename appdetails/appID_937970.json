You can avoid them by moving the character up or down the lane or by jumping over some of them (not all) using 'Space' or sliding using the right arrow. If you hit any of the obstacles, your character will lose a life. But don't worry: you can restore up to 5 lives if you gather a Heart bonus (one life for each Heart).
