Therefore I want to stand by this game of mine, which I nurtured since development phase. I can\u2019t overlook the fact that my game stories, inspections and guides led the way during the times I raised awareness. I have to make additions to story part of things.</i><br><br>Hello there! This is my first game, and I feel honour and pride to share it with my fellow gamers. Unseen Anchor has an endless and repeatable playability, which is full of love. I\u2019ll be waiting for all your feedback on Twitter <strong>(@Yuksekolan)</strong> and on Steam forums.<br><br>Before I forget\u2026 I want to thank all my friends, who pioneered and/or supported growth and development of Steam Turkey.<br><br>Thank you all for your friendship and solidarity.<br><br>Burak,<br>Invasion Era</p><br><h1>About the Game</h1><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/779760/extras/Ready7.png?t=1552331036\" ><br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Unlimited ammo and only five energy boosts.
