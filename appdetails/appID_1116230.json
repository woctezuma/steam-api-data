As a stale product on a store shelf which was losing its value every day. After all, houses also have a shelf life. And then, one May morning the silence of our office on the Fifth Avenue was broken by a telephone call. That call changed my whole life. It was a Mr Johnson, a very strange client who was willing to seize this old junk called house. And even the fact that a family of five people disappeared in this house did not frighten him, but on the contrary it was the reason for such a strange purchase. After a brief conversation my boss decided to send me to Stonebridge, to this provincial hole in Maine.
