  "detailed_description": "When Kotachi's grandfather died, he was given a box with a pair of white revolvers- however, his parents couldn\u2019t see them. He finds that his revolvers are actually forged from the constellation Perseus, and can be used to fight of specters, monsters that fester in dark places. Kotachi meets several other characters as they all train to become certified Aligners from C.O.I.N., an organization that employs Aligners to dispel and research specters. Some constellations actually embody human forms, and are a group known as the Zodiac- a group that was previously thought to be legend, as they haven\u2019t been seen for decades. Kotachi is one of the few people in the world with a weapon strong enough to dispel the specters controlling each of the Zodiac, and thus can become their Protector, someone who shields the constellations from specters and is able to invoke their power in battle.<br><br><i>Asterism</i> at its heart is a story-heavy turn based RPG inspired by astronomy elements, namely the constellations that make up our sky- especially the Zodiac. It can be played in either the base game, an RPG with battles and exploration with visual novel style dialogue, or as a pure visual novel with choices rather than walking around. Choices accompany many of the dialogue menus in both play styles, and can determine how side characters end up by the end of the story- including an optional male love interest.<br><br><strong>Features:</strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li> 10+ hours of gameplay<br></li><li> 2 playmodes- pure visual novel and RPG + visual novel dialogue<br></li><li> Branching dialogue trees with different outcomes<br></li><li> Optional male love interest</li></ul>",

  "short_description": "Kotachi Asterio wants to help people that can\u2019t fight for themselves. But, he isn't some sort of superhero- he can just see things other people can't. During the day, he goes to high school with his best friend, Ophi. At night, the two fight off specters, monsters that lurk in shadows and can harm people.",
