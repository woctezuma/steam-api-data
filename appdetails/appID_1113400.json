Set up Special Ops to take out characters, planets.. even whole systems! Change the political landscape with one well-placed blackmail operation or even assassination!<br></li><li>Dynamic character relationship model \u2013 you can affect your relationships with Actions that you can take against characters, from giving a speech to challenging them to having them executed.

Houses own territory, armies, etc. and if you piss them off, they may even try to usurp the Empire. Build alliances to allow characters with special talents and traditions to develop the Empire the way you want. For example, if you want a strong economy, you need good miners to ensure your factories run at full capacity, so you\u2019ll want House Ilioaia (who has a strong mining tradition) on your side so you can appoint their members as viceroys of high-mineral planets\u2026 and so on<br></li><li>Don\u2019t micromanage, create a Project! Unlike traditional 4X games, you don\u2019t make build queues, you create Projects to get things done, from colonizing a planet to throwing a celebration to upgrading a logistical region. You must assign an Adminstrator who gains power and influence from this post, and determines how smoothly your project will go! Assigning characters to Projects is a great way for them to earn power and influence\u2026 but take care that they do not gain too much, especially if they are of a House that hates you\u2026</li></ul>",
