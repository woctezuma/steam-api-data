I played a lot of puzzle games before and found the puzzles in these games are limited to the game itself.

Complete all levels to unlock the first achievement, and for other endings, it requires players to find out the secluded room to unlock.<br><br>Finding hidden secluded rooms in the game is also a great pleasure and achievement of the game.<br><br>I want to use this game to expose the relationship between human and the God, where the future of mankind is, the relationship between human and nature, the final end of mankind and the way home.
