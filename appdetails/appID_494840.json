You look after their physical and mental health, because if the sailors are hungry, tired and their spirit is low, there\u2019s no chance of winning even a skirmish. It is important to balance the overall discipline and trauma of your crew. If you are a harsh captain, the level of both goes up. When trauma is high a secret feature of each sailor can be disclosed.
