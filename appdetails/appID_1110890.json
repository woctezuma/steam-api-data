  "detailed_description": "&quot;MY WOLF&quot; is an interactive project in which you'll take care of a tiny wolf who will need some of your help to deal with the big world. Teach him to hunt that he was not hungry, show him what is good and what is bad and thanks to this our little wolf will grow every day and become an adult wolf.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Main functions:</strong></h2><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Advanced Wolf AI</h2> - Our Wolf is controlled by advanced AI that you can teach that our wolf can survive alone in the world. A slightly larger wolf will be fully self-sufficient but when it finds something interesting it will let you know.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Growing up a wolf</h2> - we adopt a tiny wolf who will acquire new skills with age. The wolf will slowly grow which will allow him to jump on higher obstacles to get to new places.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Open world</h2> - Our Wolf will get a big open world for exploration. A world that is diverse, interesting and mysterious. It is a place full of fun and freedom in which we will meet other animals with which our wolf will interact. Some animals will be interesting, nice and others skittish or even aggressive.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Day and night system</h2> - The world of the wolf works just like our daily system. Our wolf will be more likely to have fun during the day when he sleeps more often during the night.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Desktop wallpaper</h2> - The project is displayed as an interactive wallpaper and our trained wolf will mostly be able to cope by himself, so you do not have to look after him constantly.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Multi-screen support</h2> - The wallpaper can be displayed on one selected screen. Thanks to this you can work on one screen and look after your wolf on the other screen. By default, wallpaper is expanded to all available screens. It is then recommended to have screens of the same size and resolution. Important: The wallpaper always works in the largest screen resolution available for monitors.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Automatic pause</h2> - When you want to play a normal game, the wallpaper automatically (recognizes another application in full screen) will stop to give you 100% strength of your PC. When you finish playing, your wolf will return to the wallpaper.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Automatic start with Windows 10</h2> - just like your wolf's normal wallpaper will come back to the screen after re-enabling the system. (Note: the wallpaper only works on Windows 10)<br><br>MY WOLF - Wild Pet Wallpaper is a project that was created thanks to your help. Thank you very much. Every help is very important for us. Thank you!<br><br>If you notice any problems, please check our &quot;Community HUB&quot; or contact directly. I'm almost 25h to your disposition ;)<br><br>Thanks for your support!<br>3DM Team",
