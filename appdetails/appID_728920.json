  "detailed_description": "The tarot reading is a pack of playing cards used in parallel for divination in the form of tarotology and cartomancy. With our game you can have the full taro experience! It makes you feel like you are visiting a real gypsy tarot reader. She will shuffle the cards, let you choose them and then present them and explain their meanings. This is the most beautiful and fully animated Tarot card experience out there. The main deck style used is gorgeous and custom made. 4K resolution, made exclusively for us in 2019. All 78 cards are animated! <br />\r\nThis game contains 4 different spreads depending on your situation: Celtic cross spread, three cards spread, romance / love spread and career spread. It can give you a detailed explanation for advanced users or a simple one for beginners. The game is translated in 8 languages and all results can be sent in your email. It contains 5 full decks of cards. The main one is our own custom made, animated deck and 4 historic Marseilles decks: Grimaud 1930, Conver 1760, Dodal 1715 and Noblet 1650. You can have your own reading which can be saved in 10 slots or a multiplayer in your living room to compare your results with your friends. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nHow its done: First, you will have to write your tarot question, such as: \u2018Is my marriage going to last?\u2019 or \u2018Do I have a chance with Mary?\u2019. Then you choose the cards you want and that\u2019s it! After that, the gypsy tarot reader explains each card in detail. There is also a summary at the end of the reading. After you get the answer all readings are saved in 10 slots to view them as many times as you like. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe game can be used as a tarot adviser or spiritual advisor. Shuffle the cards against friends with details or simple yesno tarot. Use many deck of cards, card valet and get tarot plus experience. Our animated tarrot cards cannot be found in other apps.
