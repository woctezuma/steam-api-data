  "reviews": "\u201cThe tactical depth is impressive, as is the need for an overarching strategy. ... Battlefield management is where the game feels strongest. This isn\u2019t an all-out slugfest in which you must demolish the opposition to win the map. Win conditions are contingent on a number of objectives available in each scenario, and attempting to wipe out the opposition rather than fulfilling an objective will likely lead to a messy end for your troops. Or, worse, you'll simply run out of turns. It\u2019s these stipulations and tabletop conceits that drive the core experience, and there is a lot to like about them. They provide a level of differentiation that helps make Fractured Empire feel like its own entity rather than just another turn-based futuristic war game.\u201d<br><a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://www.gameplanet.com.au/pc/reviews/g54d19aa7abf77/Exodus-Wars-Fractured-Empire-review\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >Gameplanet</a></a><br><br>\u201cMembraine Studios feel that anyone with even the slightest interest in tabletop gaming will love Fractured Empire, and I tend to agree. However, I would broaden this statement. Turn-based strategy games have made something of a resurgence in recent times (think the XCOM: Enemy Unknown or the Shadowrun remakes) and Fractured Empire fits brilliantly into this trend. I would say that anyone interested in turn-based strategy -- or even just being able to command armies of bad-ass war machines -- will also enjoy this game.\u201d<br><a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=https://itunes.apple.com/au/app/id931272336\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >Grab It Magazine</a></a><br><br>\u201cUltimately, it\u2019s an enjoyable and accurate adaptation of tabletop wargaming on PC, and a must-have for fans of the genre.\u201d<br><a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://wargamer.com/article/3706/pc-game-preview-exodus-wars-fractured-empire-early-access-preview\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >The Wargamer</a></a><br>",
