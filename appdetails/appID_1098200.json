(sorry, I can only afford the cost of the Xbox controller)<br><br>Hello, I am a personal developer who develops the games I want to achieve by continually learning programming knowledge. I have always wanted to develop a driving drift game with a retro cyber style. According to my idea, this game should have a simple drift system that makes it easy for players to play. So I spent a lot of time preparing and adjusting the driving control system in the game, making it easy to get started and easy to drift. This driving system is definitely different from the usual driving system, It is designed for fast drift.<br><br>Please expect &quot;Until Forever&quot; to be a single (no AI) driving drift game, It's fast, easy, tight, and repeatable, with elements of collection and challenges. In the game you can choose the track you like to drift and challenge the global leaderboard, or you just park your car on the side of the road and enjoy the unique retro cyber atmosphere in the game. I am very grateful for the feedback and bug report.<br><br>Thank you for taking a moment to read this, I really hope you enjoy this game.</strong><br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1098200/extras/2_e.png?t=1561107737\" ><br><br><strong><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>1 playground map, 4 track maps.<br></li><li>Two game modes, calculating time or not calculating time.<br></li><li>Each track has a global leaderboard!<br></li><li>Reach the goal and unlock new car paint.</li></ul></strong><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1098200/extras/3_e.png?t=1561107737\" ><br><br><strong><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>A driving drift game full of retro cyber ambience.<br></li><li>Easy to learn driving drift system.<br></li><li>The pace of the game is fast, and drifting in the world of retro cyber is addictive.<br></li><li>Unlock more car paints.
