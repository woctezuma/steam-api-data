Defeated enemies drop <strong>power ups</strong>: healing, energy and currency. Healing restores your unit's health points. Energy is used to <strong>level up</strong> your unit's stats (which are not permanent, once you are defeated they are gone!) or use <strong>skills</strong>. Each unit has 3 different skills which should be used strategically to survive as long as possible. Currency collected persists through defeat and is used in loadout.<br><br></li><li> Eventually you get defeated or actually win the game by beating final boss. In case of defeat you are sent back to loadout where you prepare and start next run. When you win, well, you win - you can save your achieved score and test your skills in new playthrough on a higher difficulty level.</li></ul>",
