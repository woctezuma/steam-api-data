Wielding a mysterious energy, and advanced  flying machines capable of utilizing it, Levin's forces quashed the  warring Nations of Old, and brought peace to the new World-Nation. But  it was not to last. As time passed, the Nations of Old resurfaced,  bearing the energy that been used against them in ages past. They  shattered the territory of the World-Nation into pieces, carving swathes  of the land for themselves. However, they did not do this on their own. Fearing the coming of a second Hero, the Nations turned to mercenaries to act on their behalf and carry the pretense of global peace.<br><br>One such mercenary company was the Yellow Jackets. Acting as the regional  army and air force for the great Kingdom of Liefton, the Yellow Jackets  bore a code of honor atypical of the cutthroat bands typically employed by sovereign nations. Their commitment to virtue, and their growing  influence in the region, lent themselves many enemies among rival  nations and mercenaries alike.<br><br>This is their story.</i><br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1118550/extras/FurySkyDesc1.png?t=1564111414\" ><br><br>Fury's Sky is a game both unique and familiar.
