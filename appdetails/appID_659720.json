It is now no longer a city, but a battleground littered with danger. Awaiting you are secrets of the past, so that the city's true colors can be known. Xalia's internal conflict is both to learn of her origin, and her place amongst the ruins of the world left behind. Will she take a side in the war that consumes the world beyond?<br><br>Luanrel, a militant leader, came to Tarentia in search of the rumored syr's heart. With her forces, and her allies who join them in the war against the syr, she delved into the heart to see it destroyed, alongside all of the syr controlled by it. Upon arriving, some soldiers went missing. With the rest of her men, she pressed forward, only to be ambushed by and separated from her soldiers. What is to come of her unit? Could any of them have survived in this techmaturgical deathtrap? Her mission is clear: Plunge the sword that felled legends into the heart of this war machine, ending it for good, or die trying.<br><br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/659720/extras/About.png?t=1519140249\" ><br><br>Xenocite Clad places you in the abandoned world of an advanced civilization, that mysteriously disappeared overnight. Centuries later, the ruins have been revitalized, bringing back life forms of varying hostilities. Brave these ruins against predators, unforeseen allies, and more as you search for a resolution to your conflicts as one of two heroines- Xalia the syr, wielding an energy blade and her Energy Compressor Drone, E, immerse yourself in the knowledge of your forefathers' civilization, and what caused their immediate disappearance.
