The bow, and crossbow are the favourites in her arsenal. A small axe can be used for quick attacks in close quarters. To keep her enemies at range, she has a bag full of caltrops to slow them down.<br><br><strong>Crusader</strong><br>The almost perfect soldier. He is all that you want from a melee fighter. Swords and shields are his weapons of choice. For ranged combat he has daggers that he can throw.<br><br><strong>Plague Doctor</strong><br>If you loose your head to a sword, then there is no need to call on the doctor. But if you are hurt or bleeding, then the doctor has the medicine to get you going. Whatever the toxic is, that the good doctor keeps in his syringe matters not, as long as he gets you going. Better keep him as a friend, as the toxic mixtures that he keeps can also be as deadly for a foe. He also has an axe for close encounters and has bottles of fumes that blurs the vision and makes for a great escape.<br><br><strong>Blacksmith</strong><br>With his hammer he can do miracles. He can build siege engines, repair broken structures. He also manufactures weapons, arrows and other stuff you need to keep the battle going. Fire is an element that he knows well and use in all forms.
