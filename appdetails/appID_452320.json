The catch? At the same time, they are all controlling snipers trying to identify and eliminate each other\u2019s spies. There are two ways to win: completing the missions first or killing the other spies.<br><br>The game's aesthetics are inspired by classic movies, immersing the players in an espionage atmosphere. Try to imagine James Bond and Austin Powers, infiltrated in a party hosted by Kim Jong-Un, competing to see who can sabotage it first. All delivered in an awesome-looking retro pixel art!<br><strong><br>Party Saboteurs is primarily a competitive local multiplayer game, so, it's designed to be played on a couch by, ideally, 3 or 4 people (or 8, if you share controllers!).
