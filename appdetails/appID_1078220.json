It's interesting to see how these original Complete books continue to set the pattern for wizardly D&amp;D supplements today: new options, new class expansions and customizations, and new spells. If you're playing a 2nd edition spellcaster, this is a book you'll want to have.<br><br><strong>Schooling the Opposition.</strong> The book begins with a comprehensive discussion of the schools of magic, a subject touched on only briefly in earlier editions of D&amp;D (mostly through the illusionist). Here, the concept of specialist casters of all types comes sharply into focus. With benefits and significant trade-offs, specialized wizards turned out to be remarkably balanced in play. The major downside seemed to be in the paucity of divination spells for the school of Lesser Divination, which made it difficult to have a particularly cool and effective diviner.<br><br>The Complete Wizard's Handbook starts by exploring each specialty, identifying the most useful spells and schools and discussing the typical personalities of each specialty's typical membership. There's also a chapter for creating brand new schools, although I doubt these guidelines got much use in actual play.<br><br><strong>Ten Kits to a New Wizard.</strong> The wizard kits offered are surprisingly straighforward, hewing toward classic archetypes without much of the idiosyncratic and unique style that will permeate later wizard customization. Choices include the academician, amazon sorceress, anagakok (an arctic or desert shaman), militant wizard, mystic, patrician, peasant wizard, savage wizard, witch, and wu jen. Several of these do an excellent job of breaking traditional stereotypes; the peasant wizard, for instance, is a hero of the people who stays magic-item poor as he battles the upper classes. I'm not sure I'd bet on him in a fight against a patrician, but it's a nice riff on traditional magic-users. Interestingly, the witch becomes the model for 3e's sorcerers, using a powerful extraplanar patron to gain power.<br><br>Following the kits is a chapter on role-playing, suggesting ten wizard personalities (such as the &quot;intimidator&quot; or the &quot;mystery man&quot;), eleven wizardly careers (such as advisor, trader, or alchemist), and various methods for integrating wizards and arcane magic more thoroughly in your campaign world.<br><br><strong>Spelling Bee. </strong>A huge amount of space, of course, is dedicated to spellcasting. Tactics for combat, casting spells underwater or in other planes, and casting spells while blind or tied up are all discussed. Tactics and explanations for existing spells are given, adjudicating illusions are discussed in detail, and spell research is explored. The new spells are particularly interesting, giving us instant-classic spells such as chromatic orb, ghoul touch, delay death, Otiluke's dispelling screen, Mordenkainen's private sanctum, and Rary's telepathic bond.<br><br><strong>Random, Fascinating Lists. </strong>Possibly my favorite portion of the book is the last chapter, filled with short lists of random magical ideas: 25 Helpful Familiars, 5 Incredible Locations, 12 New Magic Items, 5 Debilitating Afflictions...
