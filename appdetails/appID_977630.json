Landscapes and fauna are rendered in mesmerising patterns and scored with an enchanting soundtrack by Retro Family, conjuring a magical world to lose yourself in. <br><br>From lynx cubs to elephant families, from the tundra to the jungle, from survival to cooperation, the next Shelter incarnation migrates to new territory, evolving into a bigger game world and an experience that you won\u2019t forget.",
