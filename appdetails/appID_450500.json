  "reviews": "\u201cAce of Seafood is a ridiculous game in a good way. It provides players with a simple directive \u2014 dominate the ocean \u2014 and leaves it up to their skill to make that a reality. Alongside how goofy this all looks in action, it also provides a surprisingly compelling bit of gameplay to master.\u201d<br>70 \u2013 <a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=https://www.hardcoregamer.com/2017/11/22/review-ace-of-seafood/280417/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >Hardcore Gamer</a></a><br><br>\u201cAce of Seafood is not a game about what it\u2019s like to be a fish. But it does, in oddly literal ways, imagine what it would be like for a human to be a fish, albeit a marauding and cybernetic one. But perhaps that\u2019s exactly the point. As strange as it sounds, Ace of Seafood, down in its depths, is really about how we see ourselves\u2014as human after all.\u201d<br>60 \u2013 <a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=https://killscreen.com/articles/ace-of-seafood-is-all-too-human/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >Kill Screen</a></a><br><br>\u201cAce of Seafood' Is the Laser Lobster War Game We Didn't Know We Wanted\u201d<br><a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/wnxxmx/ace-of-seafood-review\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >Motherboard</a></a><br>",
