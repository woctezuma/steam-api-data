The game involves you in winter combat throwing snowballs for melee and shooting the gun for ranged attack. You should strike your enemie's snow fortress and defend your own.

In Hasty Snow you will need to load the gun and catapult by your hand, throw snowballs very quickly and dodge the snowballs flying at you. You will be able to choose your character and attack a group of enemies who have taken refuge in the fortress and repel the attack of those who are approaching you.
