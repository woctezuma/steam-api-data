  "detailed_description": "<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">What is Kubifaktorium?</h2>Build, manage and grow a thriving settlement in Kubifaktorium, a voxel-based colony management and automation game. The game features multiple biomes to explore, plenty of resources to exploit, complex transport systems and automations to build and interesting production chains to master.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Colony Building and Management</h2>The heart of your colony consists of loyal colonists who will gather resources, farm crops and craft tools and weapons. Every colonist is unique, with their own set of skills which evolve based on the jobs they perform. Managing your colonists\u2019 needs and abilities is vital to ensuring your colony's efficiency.<br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/898720/extras/Building.gif?t=1553250745\" ><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Different Biomes</h2>In the course of the campaign you will explore and colonize multiple islands and encounter different biomes. Each biome features new enemies and challenges but also new resources to discover and process.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Logistics and Transportation</h2>As your colony grows and your production hums along, transporting the resources you need becomes more and more challenging. Kubifaktorium features a number of transportation systems like trains, conveyor belts, zeppelins and more. Automated depots and inserters are there to help you store, sort and keep track of all your goods.<br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/898720/extras/Transportation.gif?t=1553250745\" ><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Automation</h2>While your colonists are highly motivated, their work power is limited. Fortunately, your colonists know how to craft advanced machinery like automated farms, smelters, crushers etc., which you can use to automate more and more of your production.<br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/898720/extras/Automation.gif?t=1553250745\" ><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Mod Support</h2>Kubifaktorium is built to be mod friendly and allows players to create anything from localizations, new goods and industries to total conversions with new terrains and scenery. The game will support publishing and sharing mods via the Steam Workshop!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">User Interface and Accessibility</h2>The game is designed to be easy to learn and hard to master. Multiple tutorials and extensive tooltips will teach you the game\u2019s mechanics. The game\u2019s intelligent recommendation system will help you along by suggesting things to build and produce based on the current situation.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Development</h2>Kubifaktorium has been successfully Kickstarted in August 2018 and has received weekly bug fixes and content patches since. I also make (bi-)monthly progress report videos in which I present the development progress. If you like, join us on Discord and share your thoughts and suggestions. :)",
