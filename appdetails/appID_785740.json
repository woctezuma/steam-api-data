Smugglers, gangs, and screaming populists call this town their home. Despair grows like a cancer, hand in hand with violence. It\u2019s a hell of a job for the new sheriff, Lilly Reed (voiced by Sarah Hamilton, of the celebrated adventure saga The Longest Journey). She\u2019s struggling to maintain order and peace, while her subordinates are uncouth men who aren\u2019t used to taking commands from a young woman.
