The world is complex, nothing is as it seems, and you must master Airhead\u2019s many abilities if you want to stand a chance of saving Head.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Companionship </h2>Body and Head must work together to accomplish their goal, and as time passes their bond and abilities will grow. What will you do to preserve their companionship?
