Each animal will require a different strategy - your <strong>netgun </strong>might be great for catching small, slow animals, but they're unreliable weapons with slow projectiles, and a large animal won't even be slowed by the impact. Instead, you might want to <strong>trap </strong>them, and use the slowdown to <strong>tranquilize </strong>them up close. <br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/975500/extras/TheWorlds2.png?t=1555080519\" ><br><strong>Exploration and discovery drive The Podlands' experience.</strong> Each world is a completely unique space.

Gallipods, for instance, live, well... Everywhere. Generally they're not that interesting, but particular worlds, such as the <strong>tropical </strong>one, will often carry rare versions of the animal. Meanwhile, the <strong>steppe </strong>world contains various special species, which aren't found elsewhere.

You'll always want to be hunting large and special specimens first. Each of these dinosaurs can then be sold to bring in some extra Podpounds, which you can in turn spend on <strong>better equipment</strong>, or <strong>access to new worlds</strong>. To maximize your profits, you can take <strong>contracts </strong>on specific animals. Bring them back succesfully, and you'll be able to significantly increase your earnings, seriously speeding up your growth.",
