Computer was their governor, and it thought up to send spy-ships to all ends of the Universe very long time ago. Its creators, black people, unlike white people who didn't know wars, were at war very often, almost all the time. So proceeded the whole centuries until one their part has won against another. But having even won, they couldn't begin to lead happy life. The fear that someone can attack them any minute made their life miserable.
