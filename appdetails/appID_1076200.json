Fog of war will prevent you from seeing the whole map, so some exploring will always be necessary. It's up to you decide which areas you'll discover, but be quick - for the Roguebook is always nipping at your heels as you go.

Each hero will have their own unique traits, like Wisdom, Cunning or Strength, giving them new possibilities to solve situations they encounter. Also, we want to have chain of events.

After the events in the Chronicles of Gagana take place, it was lost and forgotten inside the depths of a faeria well. There it lingered for over a decade.<br><br>The contact with this endless source of faeria transformed the book in a terrible way. Over time, it slowly develops its own free will - and reaveled its mischievous personality. By this time, characters like Sharra and Seifer have grown into heroes and villains of legend in their own regard. Their thirst for finding new challenges will draw them to this powerful artifact, now known as the Roguebook.",
