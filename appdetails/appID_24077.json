  "detailed_description": "<p>The Class 57 was created by Brush Traction using old British Rail Class 47 (Brush Type 4) bodies with upgraded General Motors engines and running gear. For this reason Class 57s have become known as 'Body-Snatchers'.  Produced from 1997 to 2004, the Class 57 was initially intended for freight duties, until a version with electric train heating facilities was trialled in 2000 to gain interest from passenger service operating companies. The Class 57 has since served with a number of freight and passenger operators across the UK, and has enabled the old Class 47 to continue to serve, in modified form, over 40 years after the last examples were built.</p><br /><br>\t\t\t\t\t<h2>The RailWorks Class 57 Add-On includes:</h2><ul><br>\t\t\t\t\t<li>Class 57 locomotive in Freightliner livery<br>\t\t\t\t\t<li>Class 57 locomotive in Advenza livery<br>\t\t\t\t\t<li>Class 57 in additional freight livery</ul><br /><br>\t\t\t\t\t<h2>9 scenarios:</h2><br>\t\t\t\t\t<p>Free roam</p><ul><br>\t\t\t\t\t<li>Choose a Class 57 and click on it to drive it</ul><br>\t\t\t\t\t<p>Advenza \u2013 FGW Mk3 Refurb to Derby</p><ul> <br>\t\t\t\t\t<li>Today you are taking a rake of Mk3's to Derby Works for their refurbishment.
