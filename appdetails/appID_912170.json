Just like modern web browsers group their websites together, you can now do that with all of the Windows apps on your desktop, making for a cleaner and more efficient experience.<br><br>Creating groups is simple: drag a window to another window and combine them into a single window, with tabs showing in the title bar. For example, open multiple web browsers, all in one set of tabs, or Office applications like Excel and Word, all in a single, easy-to-use window. To ungroup, simply drag the tab off the group. Save existing groups and launch them at a later time, contained and ready to go. <br><br>Once a group is created, you can quickly switch between different windows with a simple hot-key or by clicking on the tab. Groupy can also automatically add launched programs into an existing tabbed group. <br><br>Groupy works on Windows 10, 8, and 7.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Features</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li> Drag and drop applications together to group them under a common tabbed interface<br></li><li> Organize multiple applications and documents together for convenient access<br></li><li> Group related tabs together for optimal workflow<br></li><li> Save groups of applications together for future usage<br></li><li> Manage tabs in quick and natural ways with the browser-like interface<br></li><li> Add new tabs to existing groups quickly and easily<br></li><li> Mouseover tabs to preview the window contents<br></li><li> Copy files between Explorer tabs.
