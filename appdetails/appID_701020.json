  "detailed_description": "Brinko is a multi layered side scrolling platformer with cartoon style artwork, presented in 30 minute episodes to mimic the TV media. You can go far and come back to the front to reach your goal hence giving a feeling of depth in a 2D game. You may also drop platforms and items to build your way towards collecting the coins that you have lost and reuniting with your friend Kobo. The option of free to place the platform allows players to pursue the challenge as they wish. Furthermore, in each episode, you have 3 days to complete the available levels, thus adding to the challenge.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Key Features</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li> <u>Game Structure</u>: With Brinko, we hope to create regular 30 minute episodes to create a more TV series like experience rather than one massive game.

The goals may also have a randomized position which gives the player a different experience every time.<br></li><li> <u>Approach</u>: Brinko gives freedom to the players to place the platforms where they want in order to reach their goal.
