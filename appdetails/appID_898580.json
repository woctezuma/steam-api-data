The hooking physics are amazing and you can pick different hooking balls and you can also change the oil pattern. The reactions are different on any of the setups you choose and that's how it is for regular bowling.&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;It's to VR bowling as ------ ----- ------ is to VR ping pong.
