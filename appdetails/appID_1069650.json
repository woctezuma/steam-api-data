In the Age of Sail, proper positioning is of the utmost importance. Gain the weather gage, sustain powerful broadsides, and anticipate the lumbering movement of enemy ships-of-the-line. Approach to  deliver a broadside at your own peril; even the most experienced captains risk demasting, loss of the ships, or death when engaging the enemy.<br><br><strong>LANDING OPERATIONS</strong><br>When broadsides are not enough; you bring the Marines! Your hardy sea infantry can board vessels, conduct landing operations, and join land forces in assaulting enemy batteries and other fortifications. Manage cover, positioning, and morale to lead your forces to victory!<br><br><strong>LAND BATTLES</strong><br>Control of the seas is only half the battle. Whether on the New World, Venerable Europe, or the many island in-between, once the war at sea is over, an invasion must commence. Take control of more traditional national armies to combat your enemies on land in major campaigns and where your small force of marines will not do.<br><br><strong>BUILD YOUR FLEET</strong><br>Success on the high seas will earn you promotions. Grow your fleet from a small squadron of unrated ships to a fearsome battle fleet complete with powerful ships-of-the-line. Customize your ships with new technology, weapons, to create a fleet that fits your tactical doctrine.<br><br><strong>MANAGE YOUR CREWS</strong><br>With every naval engagement your crewmen become more efficient and deadly. With every shot their accuracy and reloading speed improves. While sailing they improve their stamina and fine control of their ship. Board enemy ships and land marines to build proficiency in combat. Of course, every veteran\u2019s death is a huge blow to the navy.<br><br><strong>BECOME AN ADMIRAL</strong><br>After creating your admiral, choose from three starting traits which will affect your skillset. Over the course of your illustrious (or ignominious) career you will gain experience to allocate to skill improvements. Receive bonuses to supply, improve relations with the Admiralty, replenish crew, lower equipment prices, and gain other advantages to assist your campaigns.<br><br><strong>ROYAL NAVY CAMPAIGN</strong><br>You will take control of famed naval commander Horatio Nelson and follow his life and career to protect England and become the famous admiral of legend.

Your mission, to reorganize our burgeoning navy and lead them to victory, taking the first step in becoming a rising superpower.",
