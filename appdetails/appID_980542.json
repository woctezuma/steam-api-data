Pennsy\u2019s DR-6-4-2000 passenger sharks entered service in 1948 and were used system-wide on PRR\u2019s fleet of passenger trains. Originally dressed in PRR\u2019s classic \u201cfive-stripe\u201d Brunswick green passenger livery, over the years the DR-6-4-2000s wore multiple liveries and this pack includes the Sharknose in four accurate variants, with \u201cfive-stripe\u201d and \u201csingle-stripe\u201d versions in both Brunswick green and Tuscan red. In their later years, the Pennsy\u2019s DR-6-4-2000s migrated to the New York &amp; Long Branch (now NJ Transit\u2019s North Jersey Coast Line) where they were employed in commuter service.
