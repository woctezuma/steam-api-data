His clock speed isn't what it used to be, but what he lacks for in megahertz he makes up for with experience and attitude!<br><br><strong>Rad &amp; Dusty's</strong> adventure takes them through many dangerous stages of action-packed, humor-filled, hardcore platforming fun. This decaying jungle world has been infected by a fierce corruption, and it's up to the unlikely buddy-duo Rad and Dusty to save the jungle's inhabitants and restore the Elder Tree as guardian of the land.<br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/805660/extras/Rad_Rodgers_kampf_628x183.jpg?t=1553165910\" ><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Features</h2><strong>Weapons</strong>: Dusty arms Rad with a variety of radical bad-ass weaponry.
