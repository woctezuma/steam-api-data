As Tyler, you are a minuscule machine. Pencils and coffee mugs can become weapons. Chairs, stairs and bookshelves are obstacles to your progress - things that are normal take on a completely new dimension in Tyler\u2019s world. Even if you simply want to explore, all the 1950s environments are handcrafted to include a variety of puzzles, collectables, and climbables. Details are important to breathe life into a game, and, as Tyler, it\u2019s your role to find out as much as you can.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBut stairs and chairs aren\u2019t your only obstacles. Dozens of different enemies will stand in the way of your goal. While ants and rats may not be the smartest creatures, being swarmed by hordes of them will make life extremely difficult for our little friend. Luckily, you and Tyler are equipped with a variety of different weapons, from your trusty bolt-blade to boxing gloves. Samurai swords! Sticks! Cherry bombs! All of it will allow you to carve your way through the pests that have infested your home while your creator has been missing. Tyler\u2019s relying on your help, so use every tool you discover to find the right combination for you.",
