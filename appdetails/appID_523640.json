  "detailed_description": "'The Works of Mercy' is a psychological thriller inspired by the classics of the genre: Roman Polanski\u2019s 'Repulsion,' 'The Tenant' and Stanley Kubrick\u2019s 'The Shining.' The game\u2019s plot revolves around mysterious killings committed on seemingly random victims. Only this time it\u2019s the player who becomes the murderer.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n'The Works of Mercy' tells a story of a personal tragedy and wrecked psyche. When a cryptic tormentor forces the protagonist to kill people in order to save his family, the game\u2019s hero (and the player) is posed with a series of dramatic questions. Who is the tormentor? Why is he so vengeful toward the protagonist\u2019s family? How far do you have to go to satisfy him? How can you justify the killing in the sake of saving someone\u2019s life? And how will you cope with the sense of guilt?<br />\r\n<br />\r\n'The Works of Mercy' takes place in a photorealistic world as immersive as the real one. It lets the player get the very feel of roaming through murky locations and delve into the hero\u2019s mind which is put to a serious trial. The game enables you to explore a fully interactive environment featuring the best elements of such games as 'Gone Home' or 'P.T.'<br />\r\n<br />\r\n'The Works of Mercy' will leave the gamers with a lasting impression and face them with the question: how much could I sacrifice for my family? It will take the players through a dark world which gradually dissolves to an increasingly surreal vision of the protagonist\u2019s mind captured in a lethal trap.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n'The player is given various controversial missions which don't must be completed to progress through the story line but then you will take the consequences and your world will turn into a horror. You have to think a lot what you are saying and doing because somebody can die even if you don't want it. It's not easy but there is a place for outsmart your tormentor. It all depends on your perceptiveness and creativity. You decide who you want to be and what you want to do. It's great because you can play the game many times to check what will happen if you do something differently than previously. In that case the game isn't linear and has different endings. You describe the actions of your character rather than acting him out. For example, during interactive dialogues. The game gives you a lot of freedom and impact on the story.'",
