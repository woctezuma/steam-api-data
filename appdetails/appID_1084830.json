In exploring the world of Numia, and defeating the enemies he finds there, Paran earns Gears and collects ammunition, potions, and experience points. To collect these XPs, he must use the special capabilities of the sword. Like in many classic RPGs, experience points are needed to level up and improve Paran\u2019s stats.
