As a smaller-scale battle royale, every decision, every gun picked up, your drop point - it all matters. Your decisions, not the random happenstance of the map, will decide whether you get the jump on another player or are surrounded by enemies.<br></li><li><strong>The basics</strong>: 20+ guns, 25+ attachments, 15+ armours, air drops, consumables, and much more<br></li><li><strong>Unified mode</strong>: Solos and duos play against each other, duos having to share resources for their numbers advantage. Duos are the default, and we\u2019ll match you up with a team-mate quickly and easily.<br></li><li><strong>PvE</strong>: Wolf packs stalk players and are a deadly threat, while anomalies from the disaster must also be avoided to survive.<br></li><li><strong>The Map</strong>: 25km2 of ruins surround Chernobyl, with rivers, forests, destroyed towns, hidden army camps, and much more. Each game takes place across 9km2 of this area, the map changing every time you play. During Early Access we have greatly expanded the variety of landmark buildings, oddities, and curious elements present. This includes caches of precious equipment that must be hunted down with treasure maps and looted with specific tools.<br></li><li><strong>Dynamic, vote-based weather system</strong>: The weather of Chernobyl is constantly changing \u2013 you\u2019ll face clear days, harsh winds, thunderous storms, and more, all voted for by the players spectating a match. <br></li><li><strong>Time system</strong>: Each game takes place either during the morning, at noon, or as dusk begins, changing visibility and the viability of various playstyles.<br></li><li><strong>Vaulting</strong>: Climb and vault over obstacles to quickly navigate the dangerous world of Chernobyl.<br></li><li><strong>Vehicles</strong>: Dilapidated but functional jeeps dot the landscape of Fear the Wolves. Rare, loud, and obvious, they are nevertheless a speedy way to escape dangerous areas.<br></li><li><strong>Radiation</strong>: Radiation infects the battlefield at random, spreading unevenly, and offering different threats depending on intensity.<br></li><li><strong>The Extraction</strong>: Escape each map in a dramatic finale as you fight the other last players standing to extract via helicopter \u2013 be it from the ground or rooftops.<br></li><li><strong>Unique pre-game</strong>: You can see and check the map prior to deployment, and you\u2019re instantly into the match as soon as it starts. Players get to choose how many players a match starts with.<br></li><li><strong>In-game voice chat</strong>: Talk to your squad and discuss tactics.<br></li><li><strong>Spectator mode</strong>: Dead players can continue to spectate a match, and vote for weather. You can also immediately queue for a new game once dead, meaning you never have to leave the action.<br></li><li><strong>14 languages</strong>: Localisation was one of our first priorities in Early Access and the game is now available in French, German, Russian, Chinese, and eight more languages.<br></li><li><strong>Customization</strong>: Dress your best with collectable appearances across various slots.</li></ul></p><br><h1>Coming Next</h1><p><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/819500/extras/FtW_EA_Steam-Banner_Coming-Next.png?t=1547142937\" ><br><br><strong>COMING IN THE NEXT EARLY ACCESS UPDATE</strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Much requested new features<br></li><li>Big updates to wolf AI, including a new mutation<br></li><li>Unique, gameplay-altering new mechanics</li></ul></p><br><h1>About the Game</h1><a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=https://www.twitch.tv/videos/302946062\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  ><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/819500/extras/FearTheWolves_Steam_616x200_Replay.png?t=1547142937\" ></a><br>Fear the Wolves is a competitive Battle Royale FPS by Vostok Games, bringing unique elements inspired by classic FPS games to the world\u2019s hottest genre.
