It's simple, They were fun! No boats, tanks or jets to do your work for you - keep those boots on the ground! You are a soldier, you have your guns, your body and most vitally your mettle! Head out, Grunt! <br><br>With a distinctly historical arsenal made available to you, you can choose to play any way you want. A selection of the weaponry also contains attachments that were either in use on the field or being tested at the time, giving you lots of options! Unlock more guns as you progress through the ranks to become the ultimate foot-soldier!<br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1059040/extras/Banner_Image_1.png?t=1555104422\" ><br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1059040/extras/Seperator_Banner_1.png?t=1555104422\" ><br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1059040/extras/Heading_Banner_6.png?t=1555104422\" ><br><br>What's the forecast?
