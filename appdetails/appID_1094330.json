  "detailed_description": "Run Gun Die Ultimate is a top-down shooter with procedurally generated levels for our heroine to explore and fight though. The sole purpose of each level is to find your partner waiting for you at the end of the level. The gameplay is inspired by the dual joystick games of old.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nExplore for treasure, break crates and barrels, open chests and tombs, but don't stay still long as enemies will find you. Fight skeletons, shamans, run from chargers and face mini bosses (slayer, lava and acid) all while finding your way out.  <br />\r\n<br />\r\nTake the gold you earn from collecting treasure to buy new weapons or upgrade your existing ones. Please note there are no real money options or microtransactions in this game.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWe highly recommend a joystick with dual analog support.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nRun Gun Die Ultimate is designed to be tough, but not impossible in a casual adventure setting.",
