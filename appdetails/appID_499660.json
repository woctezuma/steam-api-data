  "detailed_description": "<img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/499660/extras/1.gif?t=1555444309\" ><br>Medieval Kingdom Wars brings a fresh perspective to the grand strategy genre, combining world map kingdom management with a full-on real time approach. It`s 1336, the time of the Hundred Years' War<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Grand Campaign Awaits</h2>You start the game as a minor noble, in service to your King. With over a dozen nations and over 50 Lords to choose from, each playthrough is truly unique and tells it`s own story.<br><br>There are many ways to play the game. The Grand Campaign. Classical RTS skirmish with solo, coop and multiplayer options. And a story driven introductory campaign that introduced the player to the the time period through 9 crafted scenarios.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Redefining the Genre</h2>Everything takes place in real-time, with rogue like game progression - everything you do is constantly saved, even during the battle. There are no second chances, no turns, or multiple reloads. <br>This is a first game to fuse Fixed Force and RTS gameplay. As you bring your army to battle, you can also set up your siege camp or town, collect resources and train new troops as the battle unfolds.<br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/499660/extras/2.gif?t=1555444309\" ><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Brutal Epic Battles</h2>Battles are truly epic - with up to 120 battalions per battle. Bloody sieges, pitched field battles, and naval warfare unfolds with brutal historical realism and survival elements. Includes looting corpses, or taking apart towns for resources.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Manage Towns Up-close</h2>You have the freedom to manage everything up-close and personal by entering towns in RTS mode. Task your peasants, construct buildings and walls, and position your troops. Same time you can also manage everything on the world map.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Complex Tech Tree</h2>Late Middle ages was a time of many technological breakthroughs. The game represents this with complex historical tech tree - with over 240 innovations and local technologies - from religious matters to military and innovative siege tactics.<br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/499660/extras/3.gif?t=1555444309\" ><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Feudal Diplomacy</h2>As you improve your lordship, you will engage in complex feudal system within your Kingdom. Serving your King and maintaining relations with your fellow lords, as well as influencing larger European politics. <br>Eventually you can rebel, and overthrow your King. This opens entire new level of gameplay. As you hire new Lords, divide the land between them, and engage in a complex diplomatic system of European politics.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Beautiful Game World</h2>Beautiful, living and ever changing  game world awaits you.
