It is being developed by people who genuinely love football and football management games, and wanted to design and build a game for users to enjoy, rather than to bleed money out of them.  It is philosophically the polar opposite of the browser and mobile based online football management games that saturate the market today.&quot;</i><br><br><strong>Important note:</strong> This is an Early Access title that is still in development.
