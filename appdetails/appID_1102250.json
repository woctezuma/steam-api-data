There is a pretty aggressive timer which you have to take into account, or you'll have to start over with a different set of tasks - absolutely doable, but you have to know what you are doing.

  "short_description": "Tittilium is about helping out our top of the line female android Abby, it's monday morning and it's not enough that she is still wearing the same clothes as yesterday, but she managed to deplete her batteries as well! You only got a few minutes to solve the tasks, or her cover will be compromised. Hurry up!",
