Mankind is quickly overtaken as their technology is turned against them and the energy emitted by the parasites begins to take control of those exposed.<br><br>In an act of desperation, the experimental RSK9 is constructed, a ship made of Pre-Gate materials and technology with the ability to absorb parasite energy and use it to power its incredible arsenal.
