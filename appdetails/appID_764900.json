To make ends meet she works as a caterer and, as the film opens, is left to tend to the post-funeral gathering for Hank Boyd, a quiet loner who stood accused of a horrific crime and took his own life before standing trial. Sarah knew Hank in high school and, while he was a strange kid, doesn\u2019t believe that he could do something so terrible. Her suspicions grow stronger after she meets Hank\u2019s brother David, a local cop with a checkered past, his dimwitted partner Ray who\u2019s charged with guarding the house, David\u2019s mother Beverly who\u2019s in the latter stages of dementia and Aubrey, his distant and obviously damaged younger sister. When Sarah overhears David and Ray talking her suspicions turn to alarm as it\u2019s implied they were somehow complicit in Hank\u2019s death and may have plans for her as well. Meanwhile Beverly has become convinced that Sarah is her long lost daughter while Aubrey pines for the affections of her big brother when she\u2019s not trying to ruin him. As the family is exposed and the bodies pile up, Sarah must give the performance of a lifetime if she hopes to survive, and all because\u2026 HANK BOYD IS DEAD",
