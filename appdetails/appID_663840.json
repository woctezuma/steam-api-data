Perennially upbeat Ned (Paul Rudd of I LOVE YOU MAN, 40-YEAR-OLD VIRGIN), an erstwhile organic farmer, is utterly lacking in common sense. After his girlfriend dumps him and boots him off their farm, Ned turns to his sisters, who once again come to his rescue, each taking a turn housing their troublemaker sibling. Ned's unfailing commitment to honesty creates more than a few messes in their comfortable routines, but as the sisters' lives begin to unravel, they come to realize that maybe, in his steadfast optimism, Ned isn't such an idiot after all. Also starring Adam Scott (TV's PARKS &amp; RECREATION) and Rashida Jones (TV's PARKS &amp; RECREATION, I LOVE YOU MAN).",
