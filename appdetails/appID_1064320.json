This expansion across the ocean grew faster than the law could ever hope to keep up. Dangerous and ill mannered pirates have scoured the seas unquestioned. Powerful trading guilds have long established and vigorously defended trade-routes. Only now, after countless years of lawlessness, \u201cThe Admiralty\u201d are strengthening their grasp on this dangerous new world. After spending all of your life savings, you purchase a meager vessel and set sail to this new world. Which discoveries, alliances, and treasures await you is your choice, captain.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Features:</h2><strong>Naval Combat:</strong> Fight off thieving pirates, or sink a trade vessel for their cargo.
