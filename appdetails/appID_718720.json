Choose a quantum ability that promotes offensive or defensive play-styles as you battle your way through four distinct Deathpits and slaughter hoards of deadly enemies to earn Spacebux and unlock weapons, equipment and upgrades, all in a humorous dystopian sci-fi universe.<br><br>Inspired by retro classics Doom and Smash TV, and influenced by modern co-op titles such as Left 4 Dead and Alien Swarm, it\u2019s a punchy experience - great for casual gamers but with enough challenge and tactical depth for hours of replayability.<br><br>The game now supports ONLINE TWO PLAYER CO-OP. It can also be played SINGLE PLAYER, or with up to FOUR PLAYERS over Local Area Network, which works even if your internet is offline as long as you and your friends are connected to the same router or switch, making it perfect for old school LAN parties.
